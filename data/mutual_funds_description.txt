Description of `mutual_funds`

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/mutual-funds-and-etfs

The data contains 17,007 observations of mutual fund returns and characteristics.  I downloaded this data from Kaggle which was scraped from Yahoo finance in November 2020.  I shrunk the number of columns in the original data from 118 to 45 and only kept observations for which all 45 data columns were available.  There are some reports on Kaggle of some of the data not being correct --- this is likely a byproduct of scraping the data.
