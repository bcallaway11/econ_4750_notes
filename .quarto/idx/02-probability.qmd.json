{"title":"Probability","markdown":{"headingText":"Probability","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis section contains our crash course review of topics in probability.  The discussion mostly follows Chapter 2 in the Stock and Watson textbook, and I have cross-listed the relevant sections in the textbook here.\n\nAt a very high level, probability is the set of mathematical tools that allow us to think about **random** events.\n\nJust to be clear, random means *uncertain*, not 50:50.\n\nA simple example of a random event is the outcome from rolling a die.\n\nEventually, we will treat data as being random draws from some population.  Examples of things that we will treat as random draws are things like a person's hair color, height, income, etc.  We will think of all of these as being random draws because *ex ante* we don't know what they will be.\n\n## Data for this chapter\n\nFor this chapter, we'll use data from the U.S. Census Bureau from 2019.  It is not quite a full census, but we'll treat it as the population throughout this chapter.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(haven)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# load data\nload(\"us_data.RData\")\n```\n\n## Random Variables\n\nSW 2.1\n\nA **random variable** is a numerical summary of some random event.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* Outcome of roll of a die\n\n* A person's height in inches\n\n* A firm's profits in a particular year\n\n* Creating a random variable sometime involves \"coding\" non-numeric outcomes, e.g., setting `hair=1` if a person's hair color is black, `hair=2` if a person's hair is blonde, etc.\n\nWe'll generally classify random variables into one of two categories\n\n* **Discrete** --- A random variable that takes on discrete values such as 0, 1, 2\n\n* **Continuous** --- Takes on a continuum of values\n\nThese are broad categories because a lot of random variables in economics sit in between these two.  \n\n## pdfs, pmfs, and cdfs\n\nSW 2.1\n\nThe **distribution** of a random variable describes how likely it is take on certain values.\n\nA random variable's distribution is fully summarized by its:\n\n- **probability mass function (pmf)** if the random variable is discrete\n\n- **probability density function (pdf)** if the random variable is continuous\n\nThe pmf is somewhat easier to explain, so let's start there.  For some discrete random variable $X$, its pmf is given by \n\n$$\n  f_X(x) = \\P(X=x)\n$$\nThat is, the probability that $X$ takes on some particular value $x$.\n\n::: {.example}\n\nSuppose that $X$ denotes the outcome of a roll of a die.  Then, $f_X(1)$ is the probability of rolling a one.  And, in particular, \n\n$$\n  f_X(1) = \\P(X=1) = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.example}\n\nLet's do a bit more realistic example where we look at the pmf of education in the U.S.  Suppose that $X$ denotes the years of education that a person has.  Then, $f_X(x)$ is the probability that a person has exactly $x$ years of education.  We can set $x$ to different values and calculate the probabilities of a person having different amounts of education.  That's what we do in the following figure:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=\"pmf of U.S. education\"}\nggplot(data=us_data, aes(x=educ, y=..density..)) + \n    geom_histogram(binwidth=1) + \n    xlab(\"Years of Education\") +\n    ylab(\"pmf\") + \n    theme_bw()\n```\n\nThere are some things that are perhaps worth pointing out here.  The most common amount of education in the U.S. appears to be exactly 12 years --- corresponding to graduating from high school; about 32\\% of the population has that level of education.  The next most common number of years of education is 16 --- corresponding to graduating from college; about 24\\% of individuals have this level of education.  Other relatively common values of education are 13 years (14\\% of individuals) and 18 (13\\% of individuals).  About 1\\% of individuals report 0 years of education.  It's not clear to me whether or not that is actually true or reflects some individuals mis-reporting their education.\n\n:::\n\nBefore going back to the pdf, let me describe another way to fully summarize the distribution of a random variable.  \n\n- **Cumulative distribution function (cdf)** - The cdf of some random variable $X$ is defined as\n\n$$\n  F_X(x) = \\P(X \\leq x)\n$$\nIn words, this cdf is the probability that the random $X$ takes a value less than or equal to $x$.\n\n::: {.example}\n\nSuppose $X$ is the outcome of a roll of a die.  Then, $F_X(3) = \\P(X \\leq 3)$ is the probability of rolling 3 or lower.  Thus,\n\n$$\n  F_X(3) = \\P(X \\leq 3) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.example}\n\nLet's go back to our example of years of education in the U.S.  In this case, $F_X(x)$ is the fraction of the population that has less than $x$ years of education.  We can calculate this for different values of $x$.  That's what we do in the following figure:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=\"cdf of U.S. educ\"}\nggplot(data=us_data, aes(x=educ)) + \n    stat_ecdf() + \n    xlab(\"Years of education\") +\n    ylab(\"cdf\") +\n    theme_bw()\n```\n\nYou can see that the cdf is increasing in the years of education.  And there are big \"jumps\" in the cdf at values of years of education that are common such as 12 and 16.\n\n:::\n\nWe'll go over some properties of pmfs and cdfs momentarily (perhaps you can already deduce some of them from the above figures), but before we do that, we need to go over some (perhaps new) tools.\n\n## Summation operator\n\nIt will be convenient for us to have a notation that allows us to add up many numbers/variables at the same time.  To do this, we'll introduce the $\\sum$ operation.\n\nAs a simple example, suppose that we have three variables (it doesn't matter if they are random or not): $x_1,x_2,x_3$ and we want to add them up.  Then, we can write\n$$\n  \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i := x_1 + x_2 + x_3\n$$\nMany times, once we have data, there will be n \"observations\" and we can add them up by:\n$$\n  \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \\cdots + x_n\n$$\n**Properties:**\n\n1. For any constant $c$,\n\n    $$\n    \\sum_{i=1}^n c = n \\cdot c\n    $$\n    \n    [This is just the definition of multiplication]\n  \n2. For any constant c,\n\n    $$\n      \\sum_{i=1}^n c x_i = c \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\n    $$\n  \n    In words: constants can be moved out of the summation.  \n  \n    We will use the property often throughout the semester.\n  \n    As an example,\n  \n    $$\n      \\begin{aligned}\n      \\sum_{i=1}^3 7 x_i &= 7x_1 + 7x_2 + 7x_3 \\\\\n      &= 7(x_1 + x_2 + x_3) \\\\\n      &= 7 \\sum_{i=1}^3 x_i\n      \\end{aligned}\n    $$\n  \n    where the first line is just the definition of the summation, the second equality factors out the 7, and the last equality writes the part about adding up the $x$'s using summation notation.\n  \n## Properties of pmfs and cdfs\n\nLet's define the **support** of a random variable $X$ --- this is the set of all possible values that $X$ can possibly take.  We'll use the notation $\\mathcal{X}$ to denote the support of $X$.\n\n::: {.example}\n\nSuppose $X$ is the outcome from a roll of a die.  Then, the support of $X$ is given by $\\mathcal{X} = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$.  In other words, the only possible values for $X$ are from $1,\\ldots,6$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.example}\n\nSuppose $X$ is the number of years of education that a person has.  The support of $X$ is given by $\\mathcal{X} = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 20\\}$.  Perhaps I should have chosen a larger number than 20 to be the maximum possible value that $X$ could take, but you will get the idea --- a person's years of education can be 0 or 1 or 2 or up to some maximum value.\n\n:::\n\n**Properties of pmfs**\n\n1. For any $x$, $0 \\leq f_X(x) \\leq 1$ \n\n    In words: the probability of $X$ taking some particular value can't be less than 0 or greater than 1 (neither of those would make any sense)\n\n2. $\\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} f_X(x) = 1$ \n\n    In words: if you add up $\\P(X=x)$ across all possible values that $X$ could take, they sum to 1.\n\n**Properties of cdfs for discrete random variables**\n\n1. For any $x$, $0 \\leq F_X(x) \\leq 1$ \n\n    In words: the probability that $X$ is less than or equal to some particular value $x$ has to be between 0 and 1.\n\n2. If $x_1 < x_2$, then $F_X(x_1) \\leq F_X(x_2)$ \n\n    In words: the cdf is increasing in $x$ (e.g., it will always be the case that $\\P(X \\leq 3) \\leq \\P(X \\leq 4)$).\n\n3. $F_X(-\\infty)=0$ and $F_X(\\infty)=1$ \n\n    In words: if you choose small enough values of $x$, the probability that $X$ will be less than that is 0; similar (but opposite) logic applies for big values of $x$.\n\n\n**Connection between pmfs and cdfs**\n\n1. $F_X(x) = \\displaystyle \\sum_{z \\in \\mathcal{X} \\\\ z \\leq x} f_X(z)$ \n\n    In words: you can \"recover\" the cdf from the pmf by adding up the pmf across all possible values that the random variable could take that are less than or equal to $x$.  This will be clearer with an example:\n\n::: {.example}\n\nSuppose that $X$ is the outcome of a roll of a die.  Earlier we showed that $F_X(3) = 1/2$.  We can calculate this by\n\n$$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  F_X(3) &= \\sum_{\\substack{z \\in \\mathcal{X} \\\\ z \\leq 3}} f_X(z) \\\\\n  &= \\sum_{z=1}^3 f_X(z) \\\\\n  &= f_X(1) + f_X(2) + f_X(3) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{1}{2}\n  \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Continuous Random Variables\n\nSW 2.1\n\nFor continuous random variables, you can define the cdf in exactly the same way as we did for discrete random variables.  That is, if $X$ is a continuous random variable,\n\n$$\n  F_X(x) = \\P(X \\leq x)\n$$\n\n::: {.example}\n\nSuppose $X$ denotes an individual's yearly wage income.  The cdf of $X$ looks like\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=\"cdf of U.S. wage income\"}\nggplot(data=us_data, aes(x=incwage)) + \n    stat_ecdf() + \n    xlim(c(0,200000)) + \n    xlab(\"Wage Income\") +\n    ylab(\"cdf\") +\n    theme_bw()\n```\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that about 24% of working individuals in the U.S. each \\$20,000 or less per year, 61% of working individuals earn \\$50,000 or less, and 88% earn \\$100,000 or less.\n\n:::\n\nIt's trickier to define an analogue to the pmf for a continuous random variable (in fact, this is the main reason for our separate treatment of discrete and continuous random variables).  For example, suppose $X$ denotes the length of a phone conversation.  As long as we can measure time finely enough, the probability that a phone conversation lasts exactly 1189.23975381 seconds (this is about 20 minutes) is 0.  Instead, for a continuous random variable, we'll define its probability density function (pdf) as the derivative of its cdf, that is,\n\n$$\n  f_X(x) := \\frac{d \\, F_X(x)}{d \\, x}\n$$\nRecall that the slope of the cdf will be larger in places where $F_X(x)$ is \"steeper\".  \n\nRegions where the pdf is larger correspond to more likely values of $X$ --- in this sense the pdf is very similar to the pmf.\n\nWe can also write the cdf as an integral over the pdf.  That is,\n\n$$\n  F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f_X(z) \\, dz\n$$\nIntegration is roughly the continuous version of a summation --- thus, this expression is very similar to the expression above for the cdf in terms of the pmf when $X$ is discrete.\n\n**More properties of cdfs**\n\n4. $\\P(X > x) = 1 - \\P(X \\leq x) = 1-F_X(x)$ \n\n    In words, if you want to calculate the probability that $X$ *is greater than* some particular value $x$, you can do that by calculating $1-F_X(x)$.\n\n5. $\\P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a)$ \n\n    In words: you can also calculate the probability that $X$ falls in some range using the cdf.\n\n\n::: {.example}\n\nSuppose $X$ denotes an individual's yearly wage income.  The pdf of $X$ looks like\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap=\"pdf of U.S. wage income\"}\ndens <- density(us_data$incwage, bw=5000, from=0, to=200000)\nplot_df <- data.frame(incwage=dens$x, dens=dens$y)\n\nggplot(data=plot_df, aes(x=incwage,y=dens)) +\n  geom_line() + \n  geom_ribbon(data=subset(plot_df, incwage>=50000 & incwage<=100000),\n              aes(ymax=dens),\n              ymin=0,\n              fill=\"red\",\n              alpha=.5) +\n  geom_ribbon(data=subset(plot_df, incwage>=150000),\n              aes(ymax=dens),\n              ymin=0,\n              fill=\"green\",\n              alpha=.5) + \n  xlim(c(0,200000)) + \n  xlab(\"Wage Income\") + \n  ylab(\"pdf\") + \n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n\nFrom the figure, we can see that the most common values of yearly income are around \\$25-30,000 per year.  Notice that this corresponds to the steepest part of the cdf from the previous figure.  The right tail of the distribution is also long.  This means that, while incomes of \\$150,000+ are not common, there are some individuals who have incomes that high.\n\nMoreover, we can use the properties of pdfs/cdfs above to calculate some specific probabilities.  In particular, we can calculating probabilities by calculating integrals (i.e., regions under the curve) / relating the pdf to the cdf.  First, the red region above corresponds to the probability of a person's income being between \\$50,000 and \\$100,000.  This is given by $F(100,000) - F(50000)$.  We can compute this in `R` using the `ecdf` function.  In particular,\n\n```{r}\nincwage_cdf <- ecdf(us_data$incwage)\nround(incwage_cdf(100000) - incwage_cdf(50000),3)\n```\nThe green region in the figure is the probability of a person's income being above \\$150,000.  Using the above properties of cdfs, we can calculate it as $1-F(150000)$ which is\n\n```{r}\nround(1-incwage_cdf(150000), 3)\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Expected Values\n\nSW 2.2\n\nThe **expected value** of some random variable $X$ is its (population) mean and is written as $\\E[X]$.  [I tend to write $\\E[X]$ for the expected value, but you might also see notation like $\\mu$ or $\\mu_X$ for the expected value.]\n\nThe expected value of a random variable is a *feature* of its distribution.  In other words, if you know the distribution of a random variable, then you also know its mean.\n\nThe expected value is a measure of **central tendency** (alternative measures of central tendency are the **median** and **mode**).  \n\nExpected values are a main concept in the course (and in statistics/econometrics more generally).  I think there are two main reasons for this:\n\n- Unlike a cdf, pdf, or pmf, the expected value is a single number.  This means that it is easy to report.  And, if you only knew one feature (at least a feature that that only involves a single number) of the distribution of some random variable, probably the feature that would be most useful to know would be the mean of the random variable.\n\n- Besides that, there are some computational reasons (we will see these later) that the mean can be easier to estimate than, say, the median of a random variable\n\nIf $X$ is a discrete random variable, then the expected value is defined as\n\n$$\n  \\E[X] = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} x f_X(x)\n$$\n\nIf $X$ is a continuous random variable, then the expected value is defined as\n\n$$\n  \\E[X] = \\int_{\\mathcal{X}} x f_X(x) \\, dx\n$$\nEither way, you can think of these as a weighted average of all possible realizations of the random variable $X$ where the weights are given by the probability of $X$ taking that particular value.  This may be more clear with an example...\n\n::: {.example}\n\nSuppose that $X$ is the outcome from a roll of a die.  Then, its expected value is given by\n\n$$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\E[X] &= \\sum_{x=1}^6 x f_X(x) \\\\\n  &= 1\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) + \\cdots + 6\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) \\\\\n  &= 3.5\n  \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.side-comment}\n\n<span class=\"side-comment\">Side-Comment:</span> When we start to consider more realistic/interesting applications, we typically won't know (or be able to easily figure out) $\\E[X]$.  Instead, we'll try to estimate it using available data.  We'll carefully distinguish between **population quantities** like $\\E[X]$ and **sample quantities** like an estimate of $\\E[X]$ soon.\n\n:::\n\n## Variance\n\nSW 2.2\n\nThe next most important feature of the distribution of a random variable is its **variance**.  The variance of a random variable $X$ is a measure of its \"spread\", and we will denote it $\\Var(X)$ [You might also sometimes see the notation $\\sigma^2$ or $\\sigma_X^2$ for the variance.]  The variance is defined as\n\n$$\n  \\Var(X) := \\E\\left[ (X - \\E[X])^2 \\right]\n$$\nBefore we move forward, let's think about why this is a measure of the spread of a random variable.\n\n- $(X-\\E[X])^2$ is a common way to measure the \"distance\" between $X$ and $\\E[X]$.  It is always positive (whether $(X - \\E[X])$ is positive or negative) which is a good feature for a measure of distance to have.  It is also increasing in $|X-\\E[X]|$ which also seems a requirement for a reasonable measure of distance.\n\n- Then, the outer expectation averages the above distance across the distribution of $X$.\n\nAn alternative expression for $\\Var(X)$ that is often useful in calculations is\n\n$$\n  \\Var(X) = \\E[X^2] - \\E[X]^2\n$$\n\nSometimes, we will also consider the **standard deviation** of a random variable.  The standard deviation is defined as\n\n$$\n  \\textrm{sd}(X) := \\sqrt{\\Var(X)}\n$$\nYou might also see the notation $\\sigma$ or $\\sigma_X$ for the standard deviation.\n\nThe standard deviation is often easier to interpret than the variance because it has the same \"units\" as $X$.  Variance \"units\" are squared units of $X$.  \n\nThat said, variances more often show up in formulas/derivations this semester.\n\n\n## Mean and Variance of Linear Functions\n\nSW 2.2\n\nFor this part, suppose that $Y=a + bX$ where $Y$ and $X$ are random variables while $a$ and $b$ are fixed constants.  \n\n**Properties of Expectations**\n\n1. $\\E[a] = a$ [In words: the expected value of a constant is just the constant.  This holds because there is nothing random about $a$ --- we just know what it is.]\n\n2. $\\E[bX] = b\\E[X]$ [In words: the expected value of a constant times a random variable is equal to the constant times the expected value of the random variable.  We will use this property often this semester.]\n\n3. $\\E[a + bX] = a + b\\E[X]$ [In words: expected values \"pass through\" sums.  We will use this property often this semester.]\n\nYou'll also notice the similarity between the properties of summations and expectations.  This is not a coincidence --- it holds because expectations are defined as summations (or very closely related, as integrals).\n\n**Properties of Variance**\n\n1. $\\Var(a) = 0$ [In words: the variance of a constant is equal to 0.]\n\n2. $\\Var(bX) = b^2 \\Var(X)$ [In words: A constant can come out of the variance, but it needs to be squared first.]\n\n3. $\\Var(a + bX) = \\Var(bX) = b^2 \\Var(X)$\n\n::: {.example}\n\nLater on in the semester, it will sometimes be convenient for us to \"standardize\" some random variables.  We'll talk more about the reason to do this later, but for now, I'll just give the typical formula for standardizing a random variable and we'll see if we can figure out what the mean and variance of the standardized random variable are.\n\n$$ \n  Y = \\frac{ X - \\E[X]}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}}\n$$\nJust to be clear here, we are standardizing the random variable $X$ and calling its standardized version $Y$.  Let's calculate its mean\n\n$$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n    \\E[Y] &= \\E\\left[ \\frac{X - \\E[X]}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}} \\right] \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}} \\E\\big[ X - \\E[X] \\big] \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}} \\left( \\E[X] - \\E\\big[\\E[X]\\big] \\right) \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}} \\left( \\E[X] - \\E[X] \\right) \\\\\n    &= 0\n  \\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere the first equality just comes from the definition of $Y$, the second equality holds because $1/\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}$ is a constant and can therefore come out of the expectation, the third equality holds because the expectation can pass through the difference, the fourth equality holds because $\\E[X]$ is a constant and therefore $\\E\\big[\\E[X]\\big] = \\E[X]$, and the last equality holds because the term in parentheses is equal to 0.  Thus, the mean of $Y$ is equal to 0.  Now let's calculate the variance.\n\n$$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\Var(Y) &= \\Var\\left( \\frac{X}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}} - \\frac{\\E[X]}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}} \\right) \\\\\n  &= \\Var\\left( \\frac{X}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}}\\right) \\\\\n  &= \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)}} \\right)^2 \\Var(X) \\\\\n  &= \\frac{\\Var(X)}{\\Var(X)} \\\\\n  &= 1\n  \\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere the first equality holds by the definition of $Y$, the second equality holds because the second term is a constant and by Variance Property 3 above, the third equality holds because $(1/\\sqrt{\\Var(X)})$ is a constant and can come out of the variance but needs to be squared, the fourth equality holds by squaring the term on the left, and the last equality holds by cancelling the numerator and denominator.\n\nTherefore, we have showed that the mean of the standardized random variable is 0 and its variance is 1.  This is, in fact, the goal of standardizing a random variable --- to transform it so that it has mean 0 and variance 1 and the particular transformation given in this example is one that delivers a new random variable with these properties.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Multiple Random Variables\n\nSW 2.3\n\nMost often in economics, we want to consider two (or more) random variables jointly rather than just a single random variable.  For example, mean income is interesting, but mean income as a function of education is more interesting.\n\nWhen there is more than one random variable, you can define **joint pmfs**, **joint pdfs**, and **joint cdfs**.  \n\nLet's quickly go over these for the case where $X$ and $Y$ are two discrete random variables.\n\n**Joint pmf:** $f_{X,Y}(x,y) := \\P(X=x, Y=y)$\n\n**Joint cdf:** $F_{X,Y}(x,y) := \\P(X \\leq x, Y \\leq y)$\n\n**Conditional pmf:** $f_{Y|X}(y|x) := \\P(Y=y | X=x)$\n\n**Properties**\n\nWe use the notation that $\\mathcal{X}$ denotes the support of $X$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$ denotes the support of $Y$.\n\n1. $0 \\leq f_{X,Y}(x,y) \\leq 1$ for all $x,y$\n\n    In words: the probability of $X$ and $Y$ taking any particular values can't be less than 0 or greater than 1 (because these are probabilities)\n\n2. $\\displaystyle \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} \\sum_{y \\in \\mathcal{Y}} f_{X,Y}(x,y) = 1$\n\n    In words: If you add up $\\P(X=x, Y=y)$ across all possible values of $x$ and $y$, they sum up to 1 (again, this is just a property of probabilities)\n\n3. If you know the joint pmf, then you can recover the **marginal pmf**, that is,\n\n    $$\n    f_Y(y) = \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} f_{X,Y}(x,y)\n    $$\n    \n    This amounts to just adding up the joint pmf across all values of $x$ while holding $y$ fixed.  A main takeaway from this property is the following: if you know the joint pmf of two random variables, then it implies that you know the pmf of each random variable individuals.  Thus, if you know the joint pmf, it implies that you know more than if you only knew the marginal pmfs.\n    \n::: {.example}\n\nSuppose that you roll a die, and based on this roll, you create the following random variables.\n\n$$\n  X = \\begin{cases} 0 \\quad \\textrm{if roll is 3 or lower} \\\\\n  1 \\quad \\textrm{if roll is greater than 3} \\end{cases} \\qquad Y = \\begin{cases} 0 \\quad \\textrm{if roll is odd} \\\\\n  1 \\quad \\textrm{if roll is even} \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nLet's consider what values $X$ and $Y$ take for different rolls:\n\n| **roll** | **X** | **Y** |\n|:--------:|:-----:|:-----:|\n|     1    |   0   |   0   |\n|     2    |   0   |   1   |\n|     3    |   0   |   0   |\n|     4    |   1   |   1   |\n|     5    |   1   |   0   |\n|     6    |   1   |   1   |\n\nThus,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n  f_{X,Y}(0, 0) = \\frac{2}{6} \\qquad \\qquad f_{X,Y}(0,1) = \\frac{1}{6} \\\\\n  f_{X,Y}(1, 0) = \\frac{1}{6} \\qquad \\qquad f_{X,Y}(1,1) = \\frac{2}{6}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nand you can immediately see that the first two properties hold here.  For the third property, suppose that we want to calculate $f_Y(1)$ (i.e., the probability that we roll an even number).  The property says that we can calculate it\n$$\n  f_Y(1) = \\sum_{x=0}^1 f_{X,Y}(x,1) = f_{X,Y}(0,1) + f_{X,Y}(1,1) = \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nwhich, as we know, is the right answer.\n\n:::\n    \n$X$ and $Y$ are said to be **independent** if $f_{Y|X}(y|x) = f_Y(y)$.  In other words, if knowing the value of $X$ doesn't provide any information about the distribution $Y$.\n\n## Conditional Expectations\n\nSW 2.3\n\nIt is useful to know about joint pmfs/pdfs/cdfs, but they are often hard to work with in practice.  For example, if you have two random variables, visualizing their joint distribution would involve interpreting a 3D plot which is often challenging in practice.  If you had more than two random variables, then fully visualizing their joint distribution would not be possible.  Therefore, we will typically look at summaries of the joint distribution.  Probably the most useful one is the conditional expectation that we study in this section; in fact, we will spend much of the semester trying to estimate conditional expectations.\n\nFor two random variables, $Y$ and $X$, the **conditional expectation** of $Y$ given $X=x$ is the mean value of $Y$ conditional on $X$ taking the particular value $x$.  In math, this is written\n\n$$\n  \\E[Y|X=x]\n$$\n\nOne useful way to think of a conditional expectation is as a *function* of $x$.  For example, suppose that $Y$ is a person's yearly income and $X$ is a person's years of education.  Clearly, mean income can change for different values of education.\n\nConditional expectations will be a main focus of ours throughout the semester\n\nAn extremely useful property of conditional expectations is that they generalize from the case with two variables to the case with multiple variables.  For example, suppose that we have four random variables $Y$, $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$.  It makes sense to think about \n$$\n  \\E[Y|X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, X_3=x_3]\n$$\nwhich is the expected value of $Y$ conditional on $X_1$ taking the particular value $x_1$, $X_2$ taking the particular value $x_2$, and $X_3$ taking the particular value $x_3$.  Just like before, you can think of this as a function, in the sense that changing any of $x_1$, $x_2$, and/or $x_3$ gives a new conditional mean.\n\n\n## Law of Iterated Expectations\n\nSW 2.3\n\n\nAnother important property of conditional expectations is called the **law of iterated expectations**.  It says that\n\n$$\n  \\E[Y] = \\E\\big[ \\E[Y|X] \\big]\n$$\nIn words: The expected value of $Y$ is equal to the expected value (this expectation is with respect to $X$) of the conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X$.\n\nThis may seem like a technical property, but I think the right way to think about the law of iterated expectations is that there is an inherent relationship between unconditional expectations and conditional expectations.  In other words, although conditional expectations can vary arbitrarily for different values of $X$, if you know what the conditional expectations are, the overall expected value of $Y$ is fully determined.\n\nA simple example is one where $X$ takes only two values.  Suppose we are interested in mean birthweight ($Y$) for children of mother's who either drank alcohol during their pregnancy ($X=1$) or who didn't drink alcohol during their pregnancy ($X=0$).  Suppose the following (just to be clear, these are completely made up numbers), $\\E[Y|X=1] = 7$, $\\E[Y|X=0]=8$ $\\P(X=1) = 0.1$ and $\\P(X=0)=0.9$.  The law of iterated expectation says that\n$$\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\E[Y] &= \\E\\big[ \\E[Y|X] \\big] \\\\\n  &= \\sum_{x \\in \\mathcal{X}} \\E[Y|X=x] \\P(X=x) \\\\\n  &= \\E[Y|X=0]\\P(X=0) + \\E[Y|X=1]\\P(X=1) \\\\\n  &= (8)(0.9) + (7)(0.1) \\\\\n  &= 7.9\n  \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe law of iterated expectations still applies in more complicated cases (e.g., $X$ takes more than two values, $X$ is continuous, or $X_1$,$X_2$,$X_3$) but the intuition is still the same.\n\n## Covariance\n\nSW 2.3\n\nThe **covariance** between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is a masure of the extent to which they \"move together\".  It is defined as\n\n$$\n  \\Cov(X,Y) := \\E[(X-\\E[X])(Y-\\E[Y])]\n$$\nA natural first question to ask is: why does this measure how $X$ and $Y$ move together.  Notice that covariance can be positive or negative.  It will tend to be negative if big values of $X$ (so that $X$ is above its mean) tend to happen at the same time as big values of $Y$ (so that $Y$ is above its mean) while small values of $X$ (so that $X$ is below its mean) tend to happen at the same time as small values of $Y$ (so that $Y$ is below its mean).  \n\nAn alternative and useful expression for covariance is\n$$\n  \\Cov(X,Y) = \\E[XY] - \\E[X]\\E[Y]\n$$\nRelative to the first expression, this one is probably less of a natural definition but often more useful in mathematical problems.\n\nOne more thing to notice, if $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then $\\Cov(X,Y) = 0$.\n\n## Correlation\n\nSW 2.3\n\nIt's often hard to interpret covariances directly (the \"units\" are whatever the units of $X$ are times the units of $Y$), so it is common to scale the covariance to get the **correlation** between two random variables:\n\n$$\n  \\Corr(X,Y) := \\frac{\\Cov(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\Var(X)} \\sqrt{\\Var(Y)}}\n$$\nThe correlation has the property that it is always between $-1$ and $1$.\n\nIf $\\Corr(X,Y) = 0$, then $X$ and $Y$ are said to be **uncorrelated**.\n\n## Properties of Expectations/Variances of Sums of RVs\n\nSW 2.3\n\nHere are some more properties of expectations and variances when there are multiple random variables.  For two random variables $X$ and $Y$\n\n1. $\\E[X+Y] = \\E[X] + \\E[Y]$\n\n2. $\\Var(X+Y) = \\Var(X) + \\Var(Y) + 2\\Cov(X,Y)$\n\nThe first property is probably not surprising --- expectations continue to pass through sums.  The second property, particularly the covariance term, needs more explanation.  To start with, you can just plug $X+Y$ into the definition of variance and (with a few lines of algebra) show that the second property is true.  But, for the intuition, let me explain with an example.  Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are rolls of two dice, but *somehow* these dice are positively correlated with each other --- i.e., both rolls coming up with high numbers (and low numbers) are more likely than with regular dice.  Now, think about what the sum of two dice rolls can be: the smallest possible sum is 2 and other values are possible up to 12.  Moreover, the smallest and largest possible sum of the rolls (2 and 12), which are farthest away from the mean value of 7, are relatively uncommon.  You have to roll either $(1,1)$ or $(6,6)$ to get either of these and the probability of each of those rolls is just $1/36$.  However, when the dice are positively correlated, the probability of both rolls being very high or very low becomes more likely --- thus, since outcomes far away from the mean become more likely, the variance increases.\n\nOne last comment here is that, when $X$ and $Y$ are independent (or even just uncorrelated), the formula for the variance does not involve the extra covariance term because it is equal to 0.\n\nThese properties for sums of random variables generalize to the case with more than two random variables.  For example, suppose that $Y_1, \\ldots, Y_n$ are random variables, then\n\n1. $\\E\\left[ \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \\right] = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n \\E[Y_i]$\n\n2. If $Y_i$ are mutually independent, then $\\Var\\left( \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i \\right) = \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=1}^n \\Var(Y_i)$\n\nNotice that the last line does not involve any covariance terms, but this is only because of the caveat that the $Y_i$ are mutually independent.  Otherwise, there would actually be *tons* of covariance terms that would need to be accounted for.\n\n## Normal Distribution\n\nSW 2.4\n\nYou probably learned about a lot of particular distributions of random variables in your Stats class.  There are a number of important distributions:\n\n- Normal\n\n- Binomial\n\n- t-distribution\n\n- F-distribution\n\n- Chi-squared distribution\n\n- others\n\nSW discusses a number of these distributions, and I recommend that you read/review those distributions.  For us, the most important distribution is the Normal distribution [we'll see why a few classes from now].  \n\nIf a random variable $X$ follows a **normal distribution** with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, we write\n\n$$\n  X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu = \\E[X]$ and $\\sigma^2 = \\Var(X)$.  \n\nImportantly, if we know that $X$ follows a normal distribution, its entire distribution is fully characterized by its mean and variance.  In other words, if $X$ is normally distributed, and we also know its mean and variance, then we know everything about its distribution. [Notice that this is not generally true --- if we did not know the distribution of $X$ but knew its mean and variance, we would know two important features of the distribution of $X$, but we would not know everything about its distribution.]\n\nYou are probably familiar with the pdf of a normal distribution --- it is \"bell-shaped\".\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nx <- seq(-3, 3, length.out=1000)\nplot_df <- data.frame(x=x)\nggplot(plot_df, aes(x=x)) + \n    stat_function(fun=dnorm,\n                  geom=\"line\") +\n    stat_function(fun=dnorm,\n                  geom=\"area\",\n                  fill=\"steelblue\",\n                  xlim=c(1.96,3),\n                  alpha=.2) + \n    stat_function(fun=dnorm,\n                  geom=\"area\",\n                  fill=\"steelblue\",\n                  xlim=c(-3,-1.96),\n                  alpha=.2) +\n    theme_bw() + \n    scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(-1.96,0,1.96), labels=c(expression(mu*\"-1.96\"*sigma), expression(mu), expression(mu*\"+1.96\"*sigma))) + \n    ylab(\"density\")\n```\n\nFrom the figure, you can see that a normal distribution is unimodal (there is just one \"peak\") and symmetric (the pdf is the same if you move the same distance above $\\mu$ as when you move the same distance below $\\mu$).  This means that, for a random variable that follows a normal distribution, its median and mode are also equal to $\\mu$.  \n\nFrom the plot of the pdf, we can also tell that, if you make a draw from $X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)$, the most likely values are near the mean.  As you move further away from $\\mu$, it becomes less likely (though not impossible) for a draw of $X$ to take that value.\n\nRecall that we can calculate the probability that $X$ takes on a value in a range by calculating the area under the curve of the pdf.  For each shaded region in the figure, there is a 2.5\\% chance that $X$ falls into that region (so the probability of $X$ falling into either region is 5\\%).  Another way to think about this is that there is a 95\\% probability that a draw of $X$ will be in the region $[\\mu-1.96\\sigma, \\mu+1.96\\sigma]$.  Later, we we talk about hypothesis testing, this will be an important property.\n\nEarlier, we talked about standardizing random variables.  If you know that a random variable follows a normal distribution, it is very common to standardize it.  In particular notice that, if you create the standardized random variable\n\n$$\n  Z := \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\quad \\textrm{then} \\quad Z \\sim N(0,1)\n$$\nIf you think back to your probability and statistics class, you may have done things like calculating a p-value by looking at a \"Z-table\" in the back of a textbook (I'm actually not sure if this is still commonly done because it is often easier to just do this on a computer, but, back in \"my day\" this was a very common exercise in statistics classes).  Standardizing allows you to look at just one table for any normally distributed random variable that you could encounter rather than requiring you to have different Z table for each value of $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$.\n\n\n\n## Coding\n\nTo conclude this section, we'll use R to compute the features of the joint distribution of income and education that we have discussed above.\n\n```{r}\n# create vectors of income and educ\nincome <- us_data$incwage\neduc <- us_data$educ\n\n# mean of income\nmean(income)\n\n# mean of education\nmean(educ)\n\n# variance\nvar(income)\nvar(educ)\n\n# standard deviation\nsd(income)\nsd(educ)\n\n# covariance\ncov(income,educ)\n\n# correlation\ncor(income, educ)\n```\n\n## Lab 2: Basic Plots\n\nRelated Reading: IDS 9.4 (if you are interested, you can read IDS Chapters 6-10 for much more information about plotting in `R`)\n\nIn this lab, I'll introduce you to some basic plotting.  Probably the most common type of plot that I use is a line plot.  We'll go for trying to make a line plot of average income as a function of education.\n\nTo start with, I'll introduce you to R's `ggplot2` package.  This is one of the most famous plot-producing packages (not just in R, but for any programming language).  The syntax may be somewhat challenging to learn, but I think it is worth it to exert some effort here.\n\n::: {.side-comment}\n\n<span class=\"side-comment\">Side Comment:</span> Base `R` has several plotting functions (e.g., `plot`).  Check IDS 2.15 for an introduction to these functions.  These are generally easier to learn but less beautiful than plots coming from `ggplot2`.\n\n:::\n\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n# load ggplot2 package \n# (if you haven't installed it, you would need to do that first)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# load dplyr package for \"wrangling\" data\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n```{r}\n# arrange data\nplot_data <- us_data %>%\n    group_by(educ) %>%\n    summarize(income=mean(incwage))\n\n# make the plot\nggplot(data=plot_data,\n       mapping=aes(x=educ,y=income)) +\n    geom_line() + \n    geom_point(size=3) + \n    theme_bw()\n```\n\nLet me explain what's going on here piece-by-piece.  Let's start with this code\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n# arrange data\nplot_data <- us_data %>%\n    group_by(educ) %>%\n    summarize(income=mean(incwage))\n```\nAt a high-level, making plots often involves two steps --- first arranging the data in the \"appropriate\" way (that's this step) and then actually making the plot.\n\nThis is \"tidyverse-style\" code too --- in my view, it is a little awkward, but it is also common so I think it is worth explaining here a bit.  \n\nFirst, the **pipe operator**, `%>%` takes the thing on the left of it and applies the function to the right of it.  So, the line `us_data %>% group_by(educ)` takes `us_data` and applies the function `group_by` to it, and what we group by is `educ`.  That creates a new data frame (you could just run that code and see what you get).  The next line takes that new data frame and applies the function `summarize` to it.  In this case, `summarize` creates a new variable called `income` that is the mean of the column `incwage` and it is the mean by `educ` (since we grouped by education in the previous step).  \n\nTake a second and look through what has actually been created here.  `plot_data` is a new data frame, but it only has 18 observations --- corresponding to each distinct value of education in the data.  It also has two columns, the first one is `educ` which is the years of education, and the second one is `income` which is the average income among individuals that have that amount of education.\n\nAn alternative way of writing the exact same code (that seems more natural to me) is\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n# arrange data\ngrouped_data <- group_by(us_data, educ)\nplot_data <- summarize(grouped_data, income=mean(incwage))\n```\nIf you're familiar with other programming languages, the second version of the code probably seems more familiar.  Either way is fine with me --- tidyverse-style seems to be trendy in R programming these days, but (for me) I think the second version is a little easier to understand.  You can find long \"debates\" about these two styles of writing code if you happen to be interested...\n\nBefore moving on, let me mention a few other `dplyr` functions that you might find useful\n\n- `filter` --- this is tidy version of `subset`\n\n- `select` --- selects particular columns of interest from your data\n\n- `mutate` --- creates a new variable from existing columns in your data\n\n- `arrange` --- useful for sorting your data\n\nNext, let's consider the second part of the code.\n```{r eval=FALSE}\n# make the plot\nggplot(data=plot_data,\n       mapping=aes(x=educ,y=income)) +\n    geom_line() + \n    geom_point(size=3) + \n    theme_bw()\n```\nThe main function here is `ggplot`.  It takes in two main arguments: `data` and `mapping`.  Notice that we set `data` to be equal to `plot_data` which is the data frame that we just created.  The `mapping` is set equal to `aes(x=educ,y=income)`.  `aes` stands for \"aesthetic\", and here you are just telling `ggplot` the names of the columns in the data frame that should be on the x-axis (here: `educ`) and on the y-axis (here: `income`) in the plot.  Also, notice the `+` at the end of the line; you can interpret this as saying \"keep going\" to the next line before executing.\n\nIf we just stopped there, we actually wouldn't plot anything.  We still need to tell `ggplot` what kind of plot we want to make.  That's where the line `geom_line` comes in.  It tells `ggplot` that we want to plot a line.  Try running the code with just those two lines --- you will see that you will get a similar (but not exactly the same) plot.\n\n`geom_point` adds the dots in the figure.  `size=3` controls the size of the points.  I didn't add this argument originally, but the dots were hard to see so I made them bigger.\n\n`theme_bw` changes the color scheme of the plot.  It stands for \"theme black white\".  \n\nThere is a ton of flexibility with `ggplot` --- way more than I could list here.  But let me give you some extras that I tend to use quite frequently.\n\n- In `geom_line` and `geom_point`, you can add the extra argument `color`; for example, you could try `geom_line(color=\"blue\")` and it would change the color of the line to blue.\n\n- In `geom_line`, you can change the \"type\" of the line by using the argument `linetype`; for example, `geom_line(linetype=\"dashed\")` would change the line from being solid to being dashed.\n\n- In `geom_line`, the argument `size` controls the thickness of the line.\n\n- The functions `ylab` and `xlab` control the labels on the y-axis and x-axis\n\n- The functions `ylim` and `xlim` control the \"limits\" of the y-axis and x-axis.  Here's how you can use these:\n\n  ```{r eval=FALSE}\n  # make the plot\n  ggplot(data=plot_data,\n       mapping=aes(x=educ,y=income)) +\n    geom_line() + \n    geom_point(size=3) + \n    theme_bw() + \n    ylim=c(0,150000) + \n    ylab(\"Income\") + \n    xlab(\"Education\")\n  ```\n  which will adjust the y-axis and change the labels on each axis.      \n  \nBesides the line plot (using `geom_line`) and the scatter plot (using `geom_point`), probably two other types of plots that I make the most are\n\n- Histogram (using `geom_histogram`) --- this is how I made the plot of the pmf of education earlier in this chapter\n\n- Adding a straight line to a plot (using `geom_abline` which takes in `slope` and `intercept` arguments) --- we haven't used this yet, but we will win once we start talking about regressions\n\n- If you're interested, here is a to a large number of different types of plots that are available using `ggplot`: [http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html)\n\n\n\n## Coding Questions\n\n1. Run the following code to create the data that we will use in the problem\n\n   ```{r}\n   set.seed(1234) # setting the seed means that we will get the same results\n   x <- rexp(100) # make 100 draws from an exponential distribution\n   ```\n\n   Use the `ggplot2` package to plot a histogram of `x`.\n \n2. For this question, we'll use the data `fertilizer_2000`.  A scatter plot is a useful way to visualize 2-dimensional data.  Use the `ggplot2` package to make a scatter plot with crop yield (`avyield`) on the y-axis and fertilizer (`avfert`) on the x-axis.  Label the y-axis \"Crop Yield\" and the x-axis \"Fertilizer\".  Do you notice any pattern from the scatter plot?\n\n\n## Extra Questions\n\n1. Suppose that $\\E[X] = 10$ and $\\var(X) = 2$.  Also, suppose that $Y=5 + 9 X$.  \n\n    a) What is $\\E[Y]$?\n    \n    b) What is $\\var(Y)$?\n\n2. Use the definition of variance to show that $\\Var(bX) = b^2 \\Var(X)$ (where $b$ is a constant and $X$ is some random variable).\n\n3. Suppose you are interested in average height of students at UGA.  Let $Y$ denote a student's height; also let $X$ denote a binary variable that is equal to 1 if a student is female.  Suppose that you know that $\\E[Y|X=1] = 5' \\,4''$ and that $\\E[Y|X=0] = 5' \\,9''$ (and that $\\P(X=1) = 0.5$).\n\n    a) What is $\\E[Y]$?\n    \n    b) Explain how the answer to part (a) is related to the Law of Iterated Expectations.\n\n4. Consider a random variable $X$ with support $\\mathcal{X} = \\{2,7,13,21\\}$.

How do you know?\n    \n    b) What is the expected value of $X$? [Show your calculation.]\n    \n    c) What is the variance of $X$? [Show your calculation.]\n    \n    d) Calculate $F_X(x)$ for $x=1$, $x=7$, $x=8$, and $x=25$.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"02-probability.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
