    "text": "17.2 Setup\nWe will continue to denote the outcome by \\(Y\\) and consider the case with a binary treatment \\(D\\). We will also consider the case with a binary instrument \\(Z\\). In the military service example, \\(Y\\) is a person’s earnings, \\(D\\) indicates whether they served in the military, and \\(Z\\) indicates whether they were drafted. Our interest is in learning about the causal effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\), exploiting that \\(Z\\) affects the probability of being treated and is effectively randomly assigned.\n\n17.2.1 Potential Outcomes and Potential Treatments\nWe will continue to use the notation \\(Y(1)\\) and \\(Y(0)\\) to denote the potential outcomes. Each person has potential treatment status depending on the instrument: \\(D_i(0)\\) represents treatment status if not drafted, and \\(D_i(1)\\) represents treatment status if drafted. Similarly, each person has potential outcomes \\(Y_i(0)\\) and \\(Y_i(1)\\) corresponding to earnings if they don’t serve versus if they do serve.\nBased on the pair \\((D_i(0), D_i(1))\\), every individual falls into one of four types:\n\nCompliers have \\(D_i(0) = 0\\) and \\(D_i(1) = 1\\) - they serve only if drafted.\nAlways-takers have \\(D_i(0) = 1\\) and \\(D_i(1) = 1\\) - they serve regardless of draft status.\nNever-takers have \\(D_i(0) = 0\\) and \\(D_i(1) = 0\\) - they never serve.\nFinally, defiers would have \\(D_i(0) = 1\\) and \\(D_i(1) = 0\\) - they do the opposite of what the draft tells them.\n\n\n\n17.2.2 The Four Assumptions\nWe require four assumptions for the LATE theorem.\n\nrelevance requires that \\(E[D_i(1)] &gt; E[D_i(0)]\\), meaning the instrument actually affects treatment on average.\nindependence requires that \\(Z_i \\perp (Y_i(0), Y_i(1), D_i(0), D_i(1))\\), meaning the instrument is as-good-as randomly assigned.\nthe exclusion restriction requires that \\(Y_i(D_i,z) = Y_i(D_i)\\), meaning the instrument affects the outcome only through its effect on treatment.\n\nThe most important threat to exclusion in the Vietnam draft lottery context involves educational deferments. Men could avoid the draft by enrolling in college and maintaining student status. This creates a problem: even if a man with a low lottery number doesn’t ultimately serve (because he obtained a deferment), he might have enrolled in college specifically to avoid military service.\nThis means the lottery can affect education directly, not just through actual military service. Since education affects earnings, we have two pathways:\n\\[Z_i \\to D_i \\to Y_i \\quad \\text{(allowed pathway through service)}\\] \\[Z_i \\to \\text{Education}_i \\to Y_i \\quad \\text{(violates exclusion - bypasses service)}\\]\nConsider a concrete example: John receives a low lottery number (high draft risk) and enrolls in college to get a deferment. He never serves in the military, so \\(D_i = 0\\). But his college enrollment was caused by the lottery, and college affects his earnings. The lottery has affected his outcome through a channel other than military service itself.\nThis is a violation of the exclusion restriction because the instrument (lottery number) has a direct effect on outcomes (through education) that doesn’t operate through the treatment (military service). When we compute the IV estimate, we’re attributing all of the earnings effects to military service, but some of it is actually coming from education choices induced by the lottery.\nAngrist and Krueger investigated this concern empirically and found that the lottery had relatively small effects on overall educational attainment, suggesting this channel is not quantitatively large. But this required careful investigation - the exclusion restriction is an assumption about economics and behavior, not guaranteed by the random assignment of lottery numbers. Even a perfectly randomized instrument can violate exclusion if there are multiple causal pathways from the instrument to the outcome.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. Sonnet 4.5\n\nmonotonicity requires that \\(D_i(1) \\geq D_i(0)\\) for all \\(i\\), which rules out defiers.\n\nThe monotonicity assumption is crucial and has a natural interpretation in our draft lottery example: being drafted doesn’t make you less likely to serve. Defiers don’t make sense in this context.\n\n\n17.2.3 The Proof\nThe Wald estimator (equivalent to 2SLS in this simple binary case) is defined as:\n\\[\\text{IV estimate} = \\frac{E[Y_i|Z_i=1] - E[Y_i|Z_i=0]}{E[D_i|Z_i=1] - E[D_i|Z_i=0]} = \\frac{\\text{Reduced Form}}{\\text{First Stage}}\\]\nWe now rewrite both the numerator and denominator using potential outcomes notation. For the numerator, the independence assumption implies that \\(E[Y_i|Z_i=1] = E[Y_i(D_i(1))|Z_i=1] = E[Y_i(D_i(1))]\\).\nSimilarly, \\(E[Y_i|Z_i=0] = E[Y_i(D_i(0))]\\). Therefore, the numerator becomes \\(E[Y_i(D_i(1))] - E[Y_i(D_i(0))]\\). The denominator is simply \\(E[D_i(1)] - E[D_i(0)]\\).\nTo understand what these expectations represent, we decompose them by type.\nFor the numerator, consider each group’s contribution. Never-takers have \\(Y_i(D_i(1)) = Y_i(0)\\) and \\(Y_i(D_i(0)) = Y_i(0)\\), so they contribute zero to the difference.\nAlways-takers have \\(Y_i(D_i(1)) = Y_i(1)\\) and \\(Y_i(D_i(0)) = Y_i(1)\\), so they also contribute zero. Compliers have \\(Y_i(D_i(1)) = Y_i(1)\\) and \\(Y_i(D_i(0)) = Y_i(0)\\), so they contribute their individual treatment effect \\(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\\). Defiers don’t exist by monotonicity.\nLet \\(\\pi_c\\) denote the proportion of compliers in the population. Then the numerator equals \\(\\pi_c \\cdot E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | \\text{complier}]\\).\nFor the denominator, never-takers contribute \\(D_i(1) - D_i(0) = 0 - 0 = 0\\), always-takers contribute \\(D_i(1) - D_i(0) = 1 - 1 = 0\\), and compliers contribute \\(D_i(1) - D_i(0) = 1 - 0 = 1\\). Therefore, the denominator equals \\(\\pi_c\\).\nCombining these results, we have:\n\\[\\text{IV estimate} = \\frac{\\pi_c \\cdot E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | \\text{complier}]}{\\pi_c} = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | \\text{complier}]\\]\nThis is the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE): the average treatment effect for compliers.\n\n\n17.2.4 Interpretation and Heterogeneity\nThe LATE theorem tells us that instrumental variables identifies the effect of military service for those who serve because of the draft - the compliers. Crucially, we do not learn about the treatment effect for volunteers (always-takers), who may be positively selected, or for those who would avoid service even if drafted (never-takers), who may have high outside options.\nThis highlights the fundamental issue of treatment effect heterogeneity. If the effect of military service differs across these groups - and there are strong reasons to believe it would - then the IV estimate will not equal the average treatment effect (ATE) in the population. The IV estimate gives us a credible causal estimate, but only for a specific subpopulation. This trade-off between internal validity and external validity is central to interpreting instrumental variables estimates.",

    "section": "17.2 Regression Discontinuity Designs",
    "text": "17.2 Regression Discontinuity Designs\nSW 13.4\nThe final type of natural experiment that we will talk about is called regression discontinuity (often abbreviated RD or RDD for “regression discontinuity design”). The sort of natural experiment is available when there is a running variable with a threshold (i.e., cutoff) where individuals above the threshold are treated while individuals below the threshold are not treated. These sorts of thresholds/cutoffs are fairly common.\nHere are some examples:\n\nCutoffs that make students eligible for a scholarship (e.g., the Hope scholarship)\nRules about maximum numbers of students allowed in a classroom in a particular school district\nVery close political elections\nVery close union elections\nThresholds in tax laws\n\nThen, the idea is to compare outcomes among individuals that “barely” were treated relative to those that “barely” weren’t treated. By construction, this often has properties that are similar to an actual experiment as those that are just above the cutoff should have observed and unobserved characteristics that are the same as those just below the cutoff.\nIn some sense, RD is a special case of instrumental variables; however, discontinuities are common enough in economics that it is worth considering these approaches specifically.\nLet’s explain the intuition for RD in the context of a particular example. Suppose that you are interested in how financial aid (a treatment) affects college completion. Policies like the Hope scholarship provide financial aid to students whose high school GPA is above a certain cutoff (e.g., 3.0). Students with GPAs just above 3.0 receive the treatment, while students with GPAs just below 3.0 do not. In the terminology of regression discontinuity, the student’s GPA is called a running variable, which we will denote by \\(R_i\\). The cutoff is denoted by \\(c\\) (in this case, \\(c = 3.0\\)). Treatment status \\(D_i\\) is determined by whether the running variable exceeds the cutoff: \\(D_i = 1\\) if \\(R_i \\geq c\\) and \\(D_i = 0\\) if \\(R_i &lt; c\\). We will end up comparing the average college completion rates for students with GPAs just above 3.0 to those with GPAs just below 3.0, and argue below that this comparison identifies the causal effect of financial aid on college completion for students at the cutoff.\n\n17.2.1 Key Assumption: Continuity\nThe RD design relies on a continuity assumption about potential outcomes. In particular, we assume that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y(1) | R = r] \\text{ and } \\E[Y(0) | R = r] \\text{ are continuous in } r\n\\end{align*}\\] In particular, we need this assumption to hold at the cutoff \\(c\\). Below is a plot that illustrates the continuity assumption for untreated potential outcomes, \\(\\E[Y(0)|R=r]\\). You can see that this function is continuous everywhere.\nIn the context of our financial aid example where college completion is the outcome, this function says that, absent any financial aid, the expected college completion rate is increasing in GPA, but there are not any sudden jumps in college completion rates.\nYou should probably think of continuity as being a mild assumption (with one main possible caveat that we will discuss below). In our example, students with GPAs of 2.99 and 3.01 are likely very similar in terms of their underlying ability and motivation, so we would expect their college completion rates to be similar absent financial aid.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of continuity: E[Y(0)|R=r] smooth at cutoff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolation: jump in E[Y(0)|R=r] at cutoff (vertical segment removed)\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s consider a plot where the continuity assumption is violated. This second plot shows a clear violation: a jump at the cutoff. In many applications, such a jump seems implausible. However, there is one leading case where a jump can occur: when individuals can manipulate the value of their running variable. For example, suppose that some students are highly motivated and strategically select courses to boost their GPA if they have a GPA near the cutoff (presumably this kind of motivation could also increase college completion rates). This could lead to a ``pile-up’’ of highly motivated students just above the cutoff, leading to a jump in the underlying potential outcomes at the cutoff.\nManipulation is a concern in RD designs especially when the running variable is something that individuals can, at least to some extent, control—like GPA in the example above. A different classic RD design involves studying the effect of legal drinking age on mortality, where the running variable is age in years (with a cutoff at age 21). Individuals cannot manipulate their birth date to turn 21 sooner, so manipulation is much less of a concern in this type of application.\n\n\n17.2.2 Identification\nNext, let’s work through what we can learn about the causal effect of the treatment when we have access to a discontinuity. To start with, let us think about what the observed data would look like if the treatment caused outcomes to increase on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nRD Identification: Positive Treatment Effect\n\n\n\n\nRecall that we observe treated potential outcomes for \\(R_i \\geq c\\) and untreated potential outcomes for \\(R_i &lt; c\\). This coresponds to the solid lines in the plots above. The dashed lines correspond to the unobserved counterfactual potential outcomes. Importantly, notice that there is a discontinuity in the observed outcomes at the cutoff.\nNext, let’s consider what the same plot would look like if there were no treatment effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nRD Identification: No Treatment Effect\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, which may be a bit hard to interpret because the lines are on top of each other, the main thing to notice is that there is no discontinuity at the cutoff.\nThe discussion above suggests that we can learn about the causal effect of the treatment by “zooming in” on the cutoff and checking for a discontinuity (as well as checking the magnitude of the discontinuity).\nIn particular, consider \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\tau^{RD} := \\lim_{r \\downarrow c} \\E[Y | R = r] &- \\lim_{r \\uparrow c} \\E[Y | R = r]\n\\end{align*}\\] \\(\\tau^{RD}\\) comes from comparing the expected outcomes just above and just below the cutoff. Notice that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\tau^{RD} &= \\lim_{r \\downarrow c} \\E[Y | R = r] - \\lim_{r \\uparrow c} \\E[Y | R = r] \\\\\n  &= \\lim_{r \\downarrow c} \\E[Y(1) | R = r] - \\lim_{r \\uparrow c} \\E[Y(0) | R = r] \\\\\n  &= \\E[Y(1) | R = c] - \\E[Y(0) | R = c] \\\\\n  &= \\E[Y(1) - Y(0) | R = c]\n\\end{align*}\\] where the second equality holds by writing the observed outcomes in terms of potential outcomes, and the third equality (which is the key step) holds by the continuity assumption. The result is that \\(\\tau^{RD} = \\E[Y(1) - Y(0) | R = c]\\), which is a local average average treatment effect for individuals at the cutoff.\nIntuitively, you can think of regression discontinuity as delivering a local experiment where individuals just above and just below the cutoff are effectively randomly assigned to treatment and control groups.\n\n\n17.2.3 Estimation\nFrom the discussion above, it may be unclear how to estimate \\(\\tau^{RD}\\) in practice. In particular, it is not clear how to deal with the limits in the definition of \\(\\tau^{RD}\\). In fact, I think RD is the first and only time this semester where we won’t directly use the analogy principle to estimate a parameter of interest (due to the limits). To deal with the limits, instead of using all of the data, we will only use data that is “close” to the cutoff. In particular, we will only use data where \\(R_i\\) is in the interval \\([c - h, c + h]\\) for some bandwidth parameter \\(h &gt; 0\\)—this bandwidth parameter basically determines what we mean by close. Once we have decided on \\(h\\), if you are a little clever, you can estimate \\(\\tau^{RD}\\) from a regression. In particular, you can run the following regression using only data in that interval: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (R_i-c) + \\big(\\beta_2 + \\beta_3 (R_i-c)\\big) D_i + U_i\n\\end{align*}\\] This is a regression where we (1) “center” at c, and (2) we allow for the intercept and slope coefficients to be different on each side of the cutoff. In particular, \\(\\hat{\\beta}_2\\) is our estimate of \\(\\tau^{RD}\\).\n\n\n17.2.4 Example with Simulated Data\nTo illustrate how RD estimation works in practice, let me show you an example with simulated data roughly in line with the financial aid example that we have been discussing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s estimate the treatment effect using a bandwidth of \\(h = 0.5\\) (meaning we only use observations within 0.5 units of the cutoff on either side).\n\n# Choose bandwidth\nh &lt;- 0.5\n\n# Restrict to observations within bandwidth\nrd_data_bw &lt;- rd_data %&gt;% filter(abs(R - c) &lt;= h)\n\n# Estimate RD regression\nrd_reg &lt;- lm(Y ~ D + I(R - c) + D:I(R - c), data = rd_data_bw)\nsummary(rd_reg)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Y ~ D + I(R - c) + D:I(R - c), data = rd_data_bw)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.92775 -0.18555 -0.02267  0.20556  0.74318 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The intercept shift at the cutoff (the coefficient on \\(D\\)) gives us our estimate of the treatment effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows the fitted regression lines for treated and untreated observations within the bandwidth. The vertical gap between the two lines at the cutoff (the intercept shift) is our estimate of the treatment effect.\nFinally, notice that we’re only using observations close to the cutoff (those within the bandwidth). We can zoom out to see all the data, and, in particular, notice that we are dropping a lot of data that is far from the cutoff—this typical in RD applications where the focus is local to the cutoff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows all the data but highlights the observations within the bandwidth (which appear more opaque) and shows the fitted regression lines. The shaded gray region indicates the bandwidth around the cutoff. This makes it clear that we’re only using local information near the cutoff to estimate the treatment effect.",

And I think that it is fair to say that a lot of approaches to causal inference can be considered as a variation of instrumental variables. Cunningham (2021) has a good and interesting discussion of the history of instrumental variables in economics.\n\n\n17.1.1 Setup\nWe will continue to denote the outcome by \\(Y\\) and consider the case with a binary treatment \\(D\\). We will also consider the case with a binary instrument \\(Z\\). In the military service example, \\(Y\\) is a person’s earnings, \\(D\\) indicates whether they served in the military, and \\(Z\\) indicates whether they were drafted. Our interest is in learning about the causal effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\), exploiting that \\(Z\\) affects the probability of being treated and is effectively randomly assigned.\nPotential Outcomes and Potential Treatments\nWe will continue to use the notation \\(Y(1)\\) and \\(Y(0)\\) to denote the potential outcomes. Each person has potential treatment status depending on the instrument: \\(D_i(0)\\) represents treatment status if not drafted, and \\(D_i(1)\\) represents treatment status if drafted. Similarly, each person has potential outcomes \\(Y_i(0)\\) and \\(Y_i(1)\\) corresponding to earnings if they don’t serve versus if they do serve.\n\n\n17.1.2 Latent Types\nBased on the pair \\((D_i(0), D_i(1))\\), every individual falls into one of four latent types (“latent” just means unobserved, so here we mean that every unit is one of four types, but we do not observe which type they are):\n\nAlways-takers have \\(D_i(0) = 1\\) and \\(D_i(1) = 1\\) — they serve regardless of draft status. Let \\(A_i=1\\) for always-takers.\nNever-takers have \\(D_i(0) = 0\\) and \\(D_i(1) = 0\\) — they never serve. Let \\(N_i=1\\) for never-takers.\nCompliers have \\(D_i(0) = 0\\) and \\(D_i(1) = 1\\) — they serve only if drafted. Let \\(C_i=1\\) for compliers.\nDefiers have \\(D_i(0) = 1\\) and \\(D_i(1) = 0\\) — they do the opposite of what the draft tells them. Let \\(F_i=1\\) for defiers.\n\nThere are a couple of things that are worth pointing out about these types. First, among these types, only compliers and defiers respond to the instrument. Always-takers and never-takers have treatment status that is unaffected by the instrument. Second, defiers are somewhat strange type — for example, it seems very strange that one would serve in the military when not drafted, but avoid service when drafted. To be clear, what I mean by “strange”, is that we would not expect there to be many (or any) defiers in the military service example. That it is strange/uncommon to be a defier will be important below.\n\n\n17.1.3 Four IV Assumptions\nIn order to recover a causal effect using an instrumental variable, we are going to make the following four assumptions. The first two essentially just formalize our discussion above. The second two could be strong in particular applications.\n\nRelevance requires that \\(\\P(D(1)=1) &gt; \\P(D(0)=1)\\), meaning the instrument actually affects whether or not units get treated.\nIndependence requires that \\(Z \\independent (Y(0), Y(1), D(0), D(1))\\), meaning the instrument is as-good-as randomly assigned.\nExclusion Restriction requires that \\(Y_i(D_i(z),z) = Y_i(D_i(z))\\), meaning the instrument affects the outcome only through its effect on treatment.\nMonotonicity requires that \\(D_i(1) \\geq D_i(0)\\) for all \\(i\\), which rules out defiers.\n\nThe relevance condition just says that the instrumental variable affects the probability of being treated. It rules out things like using a random number generator to draw \\(Z_i\\) as this would not affect the treatment status. Usually this is a very mild assumption, and we can check it simply by checking whether the probability of being treated is higher when \\(Z=1\\) than when \\(Z=0\\) using our sample.\nThe independence assumption says that the instrument is as-good-as randomly assigned. The way we have defined a natural experiment (like in the military service example) essentially applies that this assumption holds. That being said, this assumpton does rule out just picking some variable that you happen to observe in the data and using it as an instrument. For example, suppose you were considering using whether or not someone comes from a poor family as an instrument for military service. This would likely satisfy the relevance condition, but it would likely violate independence because family income is likely correlated with unobserved determinants of earnings.\nThe exclusion restriction says that the instrument only affects the outcome through its effect on treatment. For many applications where the instrument is effectively randomly assigned, this is the assumption that is most likely to be violated. In the military service example, this assumption could be violated if the draft lottery affects outcomes through channels other than military service itself. This could happen if there were people who go to college if they are drafted (as a way to avoid military service) but would not go to college if they are not drafted. In this case, the draft lottery would affect earnings through education choices, violating the exclusion restriction.\nFinally, monotonicity rules out defiers. As we discussed above, in many applications are the most strange latent type. Still, this assumption says that there are none at all (not just that it’s rare). To me, this assumption seems plausible in the military service example, but there are some applications where it could have more bite.\n\n\n17.1.4 Identification\nNext, let’s discuss how we can learn about causal effects under the setup that we have been considering. That \\(Z\\) is effectively randomly assigned suggests considering \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y | Z=1] - \\E[Y | Z=0]\n\\end{align*}\\] which compares the mean outcome for those with \\(Z=1\\) (e.g., drafted) to those with \\(Z=0\\) (e.g., not drafted). This comparison is often referred to as the reduced form effect of the instrument on the outcome. Our next goal is to relate this equation to potential outcomes. In particular, notice that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y | Z=1] &= \\E[Y(D(1)) | Z=1] \\\\\n  &= \\E[Y(D(1))]\n\\end{align*}\\] where the first equality holds because for those with \\(Z=1\\), the observed outcome is \\(Y(D(1))\\), and the second equality holds by the independence assumption. Using exactly the same sort of argument, it holds that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y | Z=0] &= \\E[Y(D(0))]\n\\end{align*}\\] Thus, we have that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y | Z=1] - \\E[Y | Z=0] &= \\E[Y(D(1)) - Y(D(0))]\n\\end{align*}\\] This is the average causal effect of the instrument on the outcome. It could be of interest in some cases. For example, in the military service example, this is the average effect of being drafted on earnings. However, it is not what we originally set out to learn about: the causal effect of the treatment on the outcome. To proceed, let us use the law of iterated expectations to write: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y(D(1)) - Y(D(0))] &= \\E\\big[\\underbrace{Y(D(1)) - Y(D(0))}_{(A)} | A=1\\big] \\P(A=1) \\\\\n  &+ \\E\\big[\\underbrace{Y(D(1)) - Y(D(0))}_{(B)} | N=1\\big] \\P(N=1) \\\\\n  &+ \\E\\big[Y(D(1)) - Y(D(0)) | C=1\\big] \\P(C=1) \\\\\n  &+ \\E\\big[Y(D(1)) - Y(D(0)) | D=1\\big] \\underbrace{\\P(F=1)}_{(C)}\n\\end{align*}\\] We can simplify this expression significantly:\n\nFor underlined term (A), always-takers have \\(D(1)=D(0)=1\\), so \\(Y(D(1)) = Y(1)\\) and \\(Y(D(0)) = Y(1)\\), i.e., regardless of the value of the instrument that an always-taker experiences, their observed outcome is \\(Y(1)\\). Therefore, the underlined term equals zero.\nFor underlined term (B), never-takers have \\(D(1)=D(0)=0\\), so \\(Y(D(1)) = Y(0)\\) and \\(Y(D(0)) = Y(0)\\), and this term is also equal to zero using a similar argument as for always-takers.\nFor underlined term (C), recall that monotonicity ruled out the existence of defiers, and, therefore, \\(\\P(F=1) = 0\\).\n\nPutting this all together, we have that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y | Z=1] - \\E[Y | Z=0] &= \\E[Y(1) - Y(0) | C=1] \\P(C=1)\n\\end{align*}\\] This is a helpful step as we have now expressed the reduced form effect in terms of potential outcomes of the treatment itself, which is a causal effect. The last thing that we would like to do is to try to get rid of the \\(\\P(C=1)\\) term as it is mainly just “scaling down” the causal effect term. To do this, we will consider \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[D | Z=1] - \\E[D | Z=0]\n\\end{align*}\\] which compares the probability of being treated for those with \\(Z=1\\) to those with \\(Z=0\\). This comparison is often referred to as the first stage effect of the instrument on the treatment. Using a similar argument as above, we can write \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[D | Z=1] - \\E[D | Z=0] &= \\E[D(1) - D(0)] \\\\\n  &= \\E\\big[\\underbrace{D(1) - D(0)}_{=0} | A=1\\big] \\P(A=1) \\\\\n  &+ \\E\\big[\\underbrace{D(1) - D(0)}_{=0} | N=1\\big] \\P(N=1) \\\\\n  &+ \\E\\big[\\underbrace{D(1) - D(0)}_{=1} | C=1\\big] \\P(C=1) \\\\\n  &+ \\E\\big[D(1) - D(0) | D=1\\big] \\underbrace{\\P(F=1)}_{0} \\\\\n  &= \\P(C=1)\n\\end{align*}\\] This argument is extremely similar (and easier) than for the reduced form effect. For compliers, notice that \\(D(1)=1\\) and \\(D(0)=0\\), so \\(D(1) - D(0) = 1\\). Finally, we can combine the reduced form and first stage results: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\frac{\\E[Y | Z=1] - \\E[Y | Z=0]}{\\E[D | Z=1] - \\E[D | Z=0]} &= \\frac{\\E[Y(1) - Y(0) | C=1] \\P(C=1)}{\\P(C=1)} \\\\\n  &= \\E[Y(1) - Y(0) | C=1]\n\\end{align*}\\] This is our main result. It says that taking the ratio of the reduced form effect to the first stage effect recovers the average treatment effect for the compliers. The average treatment effect for compliers is often referred to as the local average treatment effect (LATE) as it is the average treatment effect for a specific subpopulation (the compliers). The ratio of the reduced form to the first stage is often referred to as the Wald ratio.\n\n\n17.1.5 Estimation\nEstimating the LATE is fairly straightforward. We can just use the analogy principle. In particular, \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\widehat{LATE} &= \\frac{\\bar{Y}_{Z=1} - \\bar{Y}_{Z=0}}{\\bar{D}_{Z=1} - \\bar{D}_{Z=0}}\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\bar{Y}_{Z=z}\\) is the sample mean of \\(Y\\) among those with \\(Z=z\\), and \\(\\bar{D}_{Z=z}\\) is the sample mean of \\(D\\) among those with \\(Z=z\\).\nAlthough this is straightforward, in practice, it will be more convenient to use a package to make the calculation for you, as it will also calculate standard errors. You can use code like the following, where your_data is your data frame, Y is the outcome variable, D is the treatment variable, and Z is the instrument variable.\n\nlibrary(estimatr)\niv_model &lt;- iv_robust(Y ~ D | Z, data = your_data)\nsummary(iv_model)",

    "section": "17.3 Regression Discontinuity",
    "text": "17.3 Regression Discontinuity\nSW 13.4\nThe final type of natural experiment that we will talk about is called regression discontinuity. The sort of natural experiment is available when there is a running variable with a threshold (i.e., cutoff) where individuals above the threshold are treated while individuals below the threshold are not treated. These sorts of thresholds/cutoffs are fairly common.\nHere are some examples:\n\nCutoffs that make students eligible for a scholarship (e.g., the Hope scholarship)\nRules about maximum numbers of students allowed in a classroom in a particular school district\nVery close political elections\nVery close union elections\nThresholds in tax laws\n\nThen, the idea is to compare outcomes among individuals that “barely” were treated relative to those that “barely” weren’t treated. By construction, this often has properties that are similar to an actual experiment as those that are just above the cutoff should have observed and unobserved characteristics that are the same as those just below the cutoff.\nTypically, regression discontinuity designs are implemented using a regression that includes a binary variable for participating in the treatment, the running variable itself, and the interaction between the running variable and the treatment, using only observations that are “close” to the cutoff. [What should be considered “close” to the cutoff is actually a hard choice and there are tons of papers suggesting various approaches to decide what “close” means — we’ll largely avoid this and just pick what we think is close.] The estimated coefficient on the treatment indicator variable is an estimate of the average effect of participating in the treatment among those individuals who are close to the cutoff.\nThis will become clearer with an example.\nOur next type of natural experiment is regression discontinuity (often abbreviated RD or RDD for ``regression discontinuity design’’). In some sense, RD is a special case of instrumental variables; however, discontinuities are common enough in economics that it is worth considering these approaches specifically.\nThe basic idea of regression discontinuity is to exploit ``discontinuities’’ in treatment assignment rules based on a running variable. For examples, suppose that you are interested in how financial aid (a treatment) affects college completion. Policies like the Hope scholarship provide financial aid to students whose GPA is above a certain cutoff (e.g., 3.0). Students with GPAs just above 3.0 receive the treatment, while students with GPAs just below 3.0 do not. In the terminology of regression discontinuity, the student’s GPA is called a running variable, which we will denote by \\(R_i\\). The cutoff is denoted by \\(c\\) (in this case, \\(c = 3.0\\)). Treatment status \\(D_i\\) is determined by whether the running variable exceeds the cutoff: \\(D_i = 1\\) if \\(R_i \\geq c\\) and \\(D_i = 0\\) if \\(R_i &lt; c\\).\nThe key insight is that individuals just above and just below a cutoff are likely to be similar on average, creating a local randomized experiment at the threshold. This suggests that, by comparing outcomes for students just above and just below the cutoff, we could hope to estimate the causal effect of financial aid.\n\n17.3.1 Key Assumption: Continuity\nThe RD design relies on a continuity assumption about potential outcomes. In particular, we assume that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y(1) | R = r] \\text{ and } \\E[Y(0) | R = r] \\text{ are continuous in } r\n\\end{align*}\\] In particular, we need this assumption to hold at the cutoff \\(c\\). Below is a plot that illustrates the continuity assumption for untreated potential outcomes, \\(\\E[Y(0)|R=r]\\). You can see that this function is continuous everywhere.\nIn the context of our financial aid example where college completion is the outcome, this function says that, absent any financial aid, the expected college completion rate is increasing in GPA, but there are not any sudden jumps in college completion rates.\nYou should probably think of continuity as being a mild assumption (with one main possible caveat that we will discuss below). In our example, students with GPAs of 2.99 and 3.01 are likely very similar in terms of their underlying ability and motivation, so we would expect their college completion rates to be similar absent financial aid.\n\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of continuity: E[Y(0)|R=r] smooth at cutoff\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolation: jump in E[Y(0)|R=r] at cutoff (vertical segment removed)\n\n\n\n\nNext, let’s consider a plot where the continuity assumption is violated. This second plot shows a clear violation: a jump at the cutoff. In many applications, such a jump seems implausible. However, there is one leading case where a jump can occur: when individuals can manipulate the value of their running variable. For example, suppose that some students are highly motivated and strategically select courses to boost their GPA if they have a GPA near the cutoff (presumably this kind of motivation could also increase college completion rates). This could lead to a ``pile-up’’ of highly motivated students just above the cutoff, leading to a jump in the underlying potential outcomes at the cutoff.\nManipulation is a concern in RD designs especially when the running variable is something that individuals can, at least to some extent, control—like GPA in the example above. A different classic RD design involves studying the effect of legal drinking age on mortality, where the running variable is age in years (with a cutoff at age 21). Individuals cannot manipulate their birth date to turn 21 sooner, so manipulation is much less of a concern in this type of application.\n\n\n17.3.2 Identification\nNext, let’s work through what we can learn about the causal effect of the treatment when we have access to a discontinuity. To start with, let us think about what the observed data would look like if the treatment caused outcomes to increase on average.\n\n\n\n\n\nRD Identification: Positive Treatment Effect\n\n\n\n\nRecall that we observe treated potential outcomes for \\(R_i \\geq c\\) and untreated potential outcomes for \\(R_i &lt; c\\). This coresponds to the solid lines in the plots above. The dashed lines correspond to the unobserved counterfactual potential outcomes. Importantly, notice that there is a discontinuity in the observed outcomes at the cutoff.\nNext, let’s consider what the same plot would look like if there were no treatment effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nRD Identification: No Treatment Effect\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot, which may be a bit hard to interpret because the lines are on top of each other, the main thing to notice is that there is no discontinuity at the cutoff.\nThe discussion above suggests that we can learn about the causal effect of the treatment by “zooming in” on the cutoff and checking for a discontinuity (as well as checking the magnitude of the discontinuity).\nIn particular, consider \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\tau^{RD} := \\lim_{r \\downarrow c} \\E[Y | R = r] &- \\lim_{r \\uparrow c} \\E[Y | R = r]\n\\end{align*}\\] \\(\\tau^{RD}\\) comes from comparing the expected outcomes just above and just below the cutoff. Notice that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\tau^{RD} &= \\lim_{r \\downarrow c} \\E[Y | R = r] &- \\lim_{r \\uparrow c} \\E[Y | R = r] \\\\\n  &= \\lim_{r \\downarrow c} \\E[Y(1) | R = r] &- \\lim_{r \\uparrow c} \\E[Y(0) | R = r] \\\\\n  &= \\E[Y(1) | R = c] &- \\E[Y(0) | R = c] \\\\\n  &= \\E[Y(1) - Y(0) | R = c]\n\\end{align*}\\] where the second equality holds by writing the observed outcomes in terms of potential outcomes, and the third equality (which is the key step) holds by the continuity assumption. The result is that \\(\\tau^{RD} = \\E[Y(1) - Y(0) | R = c]\\), which is a local average average treatment effect for individuals at the cutoff.\nIntuitively, you can think of regression discontinuity as delivering a local experiment where individuals just above and just below the cutoff are effectively randomly assigned to treatment and control groups.\n\n\n17.3.3 Estimation\nFrom the discussion above, it may be unclear how to estimate \\(\\tau^{RD}\\) in practice. In particular, it is not clear how to deal with the limits in the definition of \\(\\tau^{RD}\\). In fact, I think RD is the first and only time this semester where we won’t directly use the analogy principle to estimate a parameter of interest (due to the limits). To deal with the limits, instead of using all of the data, we will only use data that is “close” to the cutoff. In particular, we will only use data where \\(R_i\\) is in the interval \\([c - h, c + h]\\) for some bandwidth parameter \\(h &gt; 0\\)—this bandwidth parameter basically determines what we mean by close. Once we have decided on \\(h\\), it is common to run the following regression using only data in that interval: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 R_i + (\\beta_2 + \\beta_3 R_i) D_i + U_i\n\\end{align*}\\] The estimated coefficient on \\(D_i\\), \\(\\hat{\\beta}_2\\), is our estimate of \\(\\tau^{RD}\\). The term \\(\\beta_1 R_i\\) allows for a linear relationship between the running variable and the outcome for untreated individuals, while the term \\((\\beta_2 + \\beta_3 R_i) D_i\\) allows for a linear relationship between the running variable and the outcome for treated individuals (with an intercept shift of \\(\\beta_2\\) at the cutoff).\n\n\n17.3.4 Example with Simulated Data\nTo illustrate how RD estimation works in practice, let me show you an example with simulated data roughly in line with the financial aid example that we have been discussing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s estimate the treatment effect using a bandwidth of \\(h = 0.5\\) (meaning we only use observations within 0.5 units of the cutoff on either side).\n\n# Choose bandwidth\nh &lt;- 0.5\n\n# Restrict to observations within bandwidth\nrd_data_bw &lt;- rd_data %&gt;% filter(abs(R - c) &lt;= h)\n\n# Estimate RD regression\nrd_reg &lt;- lm(Y ~ D + R + D:R, data = rd_data_bw)\nsummary(rd_reg)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Y ~ D + R + D:R, data = rd_data_bw)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.92775 -0.18555 -0.02267  0.20556  0.74318 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The intercept shift at the cutoff (the coefficient on \\(D\\)) gives us our estimate of the treatment effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows the fitted regression lines for treated and untreated observations within the bandwidth. The vertical gap between the two lines at the cutoff (the intercept shift) is our estimate of the treatment effect.\nFinally, notice that we’re only using observations close to the cutoff (those within the bandwidth). We can zoom out to see all the data, and, in particular, notice that we are dropping a lot of data that is far from the cutoff—this typical in RD applications where the focus is local to the cutoff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows all the data but highlights the observations within the bandwidth (which appear more opaque) and shows the fitted regression lines. The shaded gray region indicates the bandwidth around the cutoff. This makes it clear that we’re only using local information near the cutoff to estimate the treatment effect.\n\n\n17.3.5 Example: Causal effect of Alcohol on Driving Deaths\nIn this section, we’ll be interested in the causal effect of young adult alcohol consumption on the number of deaths in car accidents.\nThe idea here will be to compare the number of deaths in car accidents that involve someone who is 21 or just over to the number of deaths in car accidents that involve someone who is just under 21. The reason to make this comparison is that alcohol consumption markedly increases when individuals turn 21 (due to that being the legal drinking age in the U.S.). If alcohol consumption increases car accident deaths, then we should also be able to detect a jump in the number of car accident deaths involving those who are just over 21.\nThe data that we have consists of age groups by age up to a particular month (agecell) and the number of car accident deaths involving that age group (mva).\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndata(\"mlda\", package=\"masteringmetrics\")\n\n# drop some data with missing observations\nmlda &lt;- mlda[complete.cases(mlda),]\n\n# create treated variable\nmlda$D &lt;- 1*(mlda$agecell &gt;= 21)\n\nIn regression discontinuity designs, it is very common to show a plot of the data.

[The setup in this example is somewhat simplified; if you wanted to be careful about how much alcohol consumption increased car accident deaths, then we would probably need to scale up our estimate by how much alcohol consumption increases on average when people turn 21. Nevertheless, what we have presented above does suggest that alcohol consumption increases car accident deaths.]\nFinally, let me show one more plot that is common to report in a regression discontinuity design.\n\n# get predicted values for plotting\nmlda$preds &lt;- predict(rd_reg)\n\n# make plot\nggplot(mlda, aes(x=agecell, y=mva, color=as.factor(D))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(aes(y=preds)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=21) +\n  labs(color=\"treated\", x=\"age\", y=\"moving vehicle accident deaths\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the two lines that we effectively fit with the regression that included the binary variable for the treatment, the running variable, and their interaction. The “jump” between the red line and the blue line at age=21 is our estimated effect of the treatment.",

    "section": "17.6 Lab 7: Drunk Driving Laws",
    "text": "17.6 Lab 7: Drunk Driving Laws\nFor this lab, we will use the Fatalities data. We will study the causal effect of mandatory jail sentence policies for drunk driving on traffic fatalities. The Fatalities data consists of panel data of traffic fatality death rates, whether or not a state has a mandatory jail sentence policy or not as well as several other variables from 1982-1988. Economic theory suggests that raising the cost of some behavior (in this case, you can think of a mandatory jail sentence as raising the cost of drunk driving) will lead to less of that behavior. That being said, it’s both interesting to test this theory and also consider the magnitude of this effect. That’s what we’ll do in this problem.\n\nThis data comes in a somewhat messier format than some of the data that we have used previously. To start with, create a new column in the data called afatal_per_million that is the number of alcohol involved vehicle fatalities per millions people in a state in a particular year. The variable afatal contains the total number of alcohol involved vehicle fatalities, and the variable pop contains the total population in a state.\nUsing a subset of the data from 1988, run a regression of afatal_per_million on whether or not a state has a mandatory jail sentence policy jail. How do you interpret the results?\nUsing the same subset from part 2, run a regression of afatal_per_million on jail, unemployment rate (unemp), the tax on a case of beer (beertax), the percentage of southern baptists in the state (baptist), the percentage of residents residing in dry counties (dry), the percentage of young drivers in the state, (youngdrivers), and the average miles driven per person in a state (miles). How do you interpret the estimated coefficient on jail? Would you consider this to be a reasonable estimate of the (average) causal effect of mandatory jail policies on alcohol related fatalities?\nNow, using the full data, let’s estimate a fixed effects model with alcohol related fatalities per million as the outcome and mandatory jail policies as a regressor. Estimate the model using first differences and make sure to include time fixed effects. How do you interpret the results?\nEstimate the same model as in part 4, but using the within estimator instead of first differences. Compare these results to the ones from part 4.\nUsing the same within estimator as in part 5, include the same set of covariates from part 3 and interpret the estimated effect of mandatory jail policies. How do these estimates compare to the earlier ones?\nNow, we’ll switch to using a difference in differences approach to estimating the effect of mandatory jail policies. First, we’ll manipulate the data some.\n\nTo keep things simple, let’s start by limiting the data to the years 1982 and 1988 and drop the in-between periods.\nSecond, let’s calculate the change in alcohol related fatalities per million between 1982 and 1998 and keep the covariates that we have been using from 1982. One way to do this, is to use the pivot_wider function from the tidyr. In the case of panel data, “long format” data means that each row in the data corresponds to a paricular observation and a particular time period. Thus, with long format data, there are \\(n \\times T\\) total rows in the data. On the other hand, “wide format” data means that each row holds all the data (across all time periods) for a particular observation. Converting back and forth between long and wide formats is a common data manipulation task. Hint: This step is probably unfamiliar, so I’d recommend seeing if you can use ?tidyr::pivot_wider to see if you can figure out how to complete this step, but, if not, you can copy this code from the solutions in the next section.\nFinally, drop all states that are already treated in 1982.\n\nUsing the data that you constructed in part 7, implement the difference in differences regression of the change in alcohol related fatalities per million from 1982 to 1988 on the mandatory jail policy. How do you interpret these results and how do they compare to the previous ones? Now, additionally include the set of covariates that we have been using in this model. How do you interpret these results and how do they compare to the previous ones?\nAn alternative to DID, is to include the lagged outcome as a covariate. Using the data constructed in part 7, run a regression of alcohol related fatalities per million in 1988 on the mandatory jail policy and alcohol related fatalities per million in 1982. How do you interpret these results and how do they compare to the previous ones? Now include the additional covariates that we have been using in this model. How do you interpret these results and how do they compare to the previous ones?\nComment on your results from parts 1-9. Which, if any, of these are you most inclined to interpret as a reasonable estimate of the (average) causal effect of mandatory jail policies on alcohol related policies?",

These sorts of specifications are less common in economics, but, in my view, it seems like a reasonable approach here. That said, the results are more or less the same as earlier estimates.\n\nWe don’t have very strong evidence that mandatory jail policies reduced the number traffic fatalities. In my view, probably the best specifications for trying to understand the causal effects are the ones in part 7 (particularly, the ones that include covariates there), but I think that the the results in parts 4-9 are also informative. Broadly, these estimates are more or less similar — none of them are statistically significant and most are positive (which is an unexpected sign).\n\nBefore we finish, let me mention a few caveats to these results:\n\nFirst, I would be very hesitant to interpret these results as definitively saying that mandatory jail policies have no effect on alcohol related traffic fatalities. The main reason to be clear about this is that our standard error are quite large. For example, in the second specification in part 7 (the one I like the most), a 95% confidence interval for our estimate is \\([-23.1, 19.4]\\). This is a wide confidence interval — the average number of alcohol related traffic fatalities per million across all states and time periods is only 66. So our estimates are basically still compatible with very large reductions in alcohol related traffic fatalities up to large increases in alcohol related traffic fatalities.\nLet me make one more comment about the sign of our results. Many of our point estimates are positive; as we discussed earlier, it is hard to rationalize harsher punishments increasing alcohol related traffic fatalities. I think the main explanation for these results is just that our estimates are pretty noisy and, therefore, more or less “by chance” we are getting estimates that have an unexpected sign. But there are some other possible explanations that are worth mentioning. For one, there are a number of other policies related to drunk driving that occurred in the 1980s (particularly, related to legal drinking age) but perhaps others. It is not clear how these would interact with our estimates, but they could certainly play some role. Besides that, it seems to me that we have a pretty good set of covariates that enter our models, but there could be important covariates that we are missing. For this reason, some expertise in how to model state-level traffic fatalities is actually a very important skill here (actually probably the key skill here!)",

    "text": "17.8 Coding Questions\n\nFor this problem, we will use the data rand_hie. This is data from the RAND health insurance experiment in the 1980s. In the experiment, participants were randomly assigned to get Catastrophic (the least amount of coverage), insurance that came with a Deductible, insurance that came with Cost Sharing (i.e., co-insurance so that an individual pays part of their medical insurance), and Free (so that there is no cost of medical care).\nFor this problem, we will be interested in whether or not changing the type of health insurance changed the amount of health care utilization and the health status of individuals.\nWe will focus on the difference between the least amount of health insurance (“Catastrophic”) and the most amount of health insurance (“Free”). In particular, you can start this problem by creating a new dataset by running the following command: rand_hie_subset &lt;- subset(rand_hie, plan_type %in% c(\"Catastrophic\", \"Free\"))\nand use this data to answer the questions below.\n\nUse a regression to estimate the average difference between total medical expenditure (total_med_expenditure) by plan type (plan_type) and report your results. Should you interpret these as average causal effects? Explain.\nUse a regression to estimate the average difference between face to face doctors visits (face_to_face_visits) by plan type (plan_type) and report your results. Should you interpret these as average causal effects? Explain.\nUse a regression to estimate the average difference between the overall health index (health_index) by plan type (plan_type) and report your results. Should you interpret these as average causal effects? Explain.\nHow do you interpret the results from parts a-c?\n\nFor this problem, we will study the causal effect of having more children on women’s labor supply using the data Fertility.\n\nLet’s start by running a regression of the number of hours that a woman typically works per week (work) on whether or not she has more than two children (morekids), her age and \\(age^2\\), and race/ethnicity (afam and hispanic). Report your results. How do you feel about interpreting the estimated coefficient on morekids as the causal effect of having more than two children? Explain.\nOne possible instrument in this setup is the sex composition of the first two children (i.e., whether they are both girls, both boys, or a boy and a girl). The thinking here is that, at least in the United States, parents tend to have a preference for having both a girl and a boy and that, therefore, parents whose first two children have the same sex may be more likely to have a third child than they would have been if they have a girl and a boy. Do you think that using a binary variable for whether or not the first two children have the same sex is a reasonable instrument of for morekids from part a?\nCreate a new variable called samesex that is equal to one for families whose first two children have the same sex. Using the same specification as in part a, use samesex as an instrument for morekids and report the results. Provide some discussion about your results.\n\nFor this question, we will use the AJR data. A deep question in development economics is: Why are some countries much richer than other countries? One explanation for this is that richer countries have different institutions (e.g., property rights, democracy, etc.) that are conducive to growth. Its hard to study these questions though because institutions do not arise randomly — there could be reverse causality so that property rights, democracy, etc. are (perhaps partially) caused by being rich rather than the other way around. Alternatively, other factors (say a country’s geography) could cause both of these. We’ll consider one instrumental variables approach to thinking about this question in this problem.\n\nRun a regression of the log of per capita GDP (the log of per capita GDP is stored in the variable GDP) on a measure of the protection against expropriation risk (this is a measure of how “good” a country’s institutions are (a larger number indicates “better” institutions) and it is in the variable Exprop). How do you interpret these results? Do you think it would be reasonable to interpret the estimated coefficient on Exprop as the causal effect of institutions on GDP.\nOne possible instrument for Exprop is settler mortality (we’ll use the log of this which is available in the variable logMort). Settler mortality is a measure of how dangerous it was for early settlers of a particular location. The idea is that places that have high settler mortality may have set up worse (sometimes called “extractive”) institutions than places that had lower settler mortality. But that settler mortality (from a long time ago) does not have any other direct effect on modern GDP. Provide some discussion about whether settler mortality is a valid instrument for institutions.\nEstimate an IV regression of GDP on Exprop using logMort as an instrument for Exprop. How do you interpret the results? How do these results compare to the ones from part a?\n\nFor this question, we’ll use the data house to study the causal effect of incumbency on the probability that a member of the House of Representatives gets re-elected.\n\nOne way to try to estimate the causal effect of incumbency is to just run a regression where the outcome is democratic_vote_share (this is the same outcome we’ll use below) and where the model includes a dummy variable for whether or not the democratic candidate is an incumbent. What are some limitions of this strategy?\nThe house data contains data about the margin of victory (is positive if they won the election and negative if they lost) for Democratic candidates in the current election and data about the Democratic margin of victory in the past election. Explain how you could use this data in a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of incumbency.\nUse the house data to implement the regression discontinuity design that you proposed in part b. What do you estimate as the causal effect of incumbency?\n\nFor this problem, we will use the data banks. We will study the causal effect of monetary policy on bank closures during the Great Depression. We’ll consider an interesting natural experiment in Mississippi where half the northern half of the state was in St. Louis’s federal reserve district (District 8) and the southern half of the state was in Atlanta’s federal reserve district (District 6). Atlanta had much looser monetary policy (meaning they substantially increased lending) than St. Louis during the early part of the Great Depression and our interest is in whether looser monetary policy made an difference.\n\nPlot the total number of banks separately for District 6 and District 8 across all available time periods in the data.\nAn important event in the South early in the Great Depression was the collapse of Caldwell and Company — the largest banking chain in the South at the time. This happened in November 1930. The Atlanta Fed’s lending markedly increased quickly after this event while St. Louis’s did not. Calculate a DID estimate of the effect of looser monetary policy on the number of banks that are still in business. How do you interpret these results? Hint: You can calculate this by taking the difference between the number of banks in District 6 relative to the number of banks in District 8 across all time periods relative to the difference between the number of banks in District 6 relative to District 8 in the first period (July 1, 1929).",

However, suppose that \\(W\\) is not observed so that you cannot operationalize the above regression.\n\nSince you do not observe \\(W\\), you are considering just running a regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(D\\) and \\(X\\) and interpreting the estimated coefficient on \\(D\\) as the causal effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\).

However, some individuals that were assigned to participate in the treatment decided not to actually participate. Let’s use the following notation: \\(D=1\\) for individuals who actually participated and \\(D=0\\) for individuals who did not participate. \\(Z=1\\) for individuals who were assigned to the treatment and \\(Z=0\\) for individuals assigned not to participate (here, \\(D\\) and \\(Z\\) are not exactly the same because some individuals who were assigned to the treatment did not actually participate).\nYou are considering several different approaches to dealing with this issue.

You interpret the difference \\(\\bar{Y}_{D=1} - \\bar{Y}_{D=0}\\) as an estimate of the \\(ATT\\), but your friend says that you should interpret it as an estimate of the \\(ATE\\). In fact, according to your friend, random treatment assignment implies that \\(\\E[Y(1)] = \\E[Y(1)|D=1] = \\E[Y|D=1]\\) and \\(\\E[Y(0)] = \\E[Y(0)|D=0] = \\E[Y|D=0]\\) which implies that \\(ATE = \\E[Y|D=1] - \\E[Y|D=0]\\).

    "section": "17.10 Answers to Some Extra Questions",
    "text": "17.10 Answers to Some Extra Questions\nAnswer to Question 4\nThe key condition is the parallel trends assumption that says that, in the absence of participating in the treatment, the path of outcomes that individuals in the treated group is the same, on average, as the path of outcomes that individuals in the untreated group actually experienced.\nAnswer to Question 9\n\nWhen some individuals do not comply with their treatment assignment, this approach is probably not so great. In particular, notice that the comparison in this part of the problem is among individuals who actually participated in the treatment relative to those who didn’t (the latter group includes both those assigned not to participate in the treatment along with those assigned to participate in the treatment, but ultimately didn’t actually participate). This suggests that this approach would generally lead to biased estimates of the \\(ATT\\). In the particular context of job training, you can see this would not be such a good idea if, for example, the people who were assigned to the job training program but who did not participate tended to do this because they were able to find a job before the job training program started.\nThis approach is likely to be better. By construction, \\(Z\\) is not correlated with \\(U\\) (since \\(Z\\) is randomly assigned). \\(Z\\) is also likely to be positively correlated with \\(Z\\) (in particular, this will be the case if being randomly assigned to treatment increases the probability of being treated). This implies that \\(Z\\) is a valid instrument and should be able to deliver a reasonable estimate of the effect of participating in the treatment.\n\nAnswer to Question 10\nWhile your friend’s explanation is not technically wrong, it seems to me that you are more right than your friend. There is an important issue related to external validity here. The group of people that show up to participate in the experiment could be (and likely are) quite different from the general population. Interpreting the results of the experiment as being an \\(ATE\\) (in the sense of across the entire population) is therefore likely to be incorrect — or at least would require extra assumptions and/or justifications. Interpreting them as an \\(ATT\\) (i.e., as the effect among those who participated in the treatment) is still perfectly reasonable though.",

    "section": "17.3 Extra: Classical Version of Instrumental Variables",
    "text": "17.3 Extra: Classical Version of Instrumental Variables\nSW all of chapter 12\nLet’s formalize these arguments. Using the same arguments as before, suppose we have a regression that we’d like to run\n\\[\n  Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\alpha D_i + \\underbrace{\\beta_1 W_i + U_i}_{V_i}\n\\] and interpret our estimate of \\(\\alpha\\) as an estimate of the causal effect of participating in the treatment. And where, for simplicity, I am not including any \\(X\\) covariates and where we do not observe \\(W\\). If \\(D\\) is correlated with \\(W\\), then just ignoring \\(W\\) and running a regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(D\\) will result in omitted variable bias so that regression does not recover an estimate of \\(\\alpha\\). To help with the discussion below, we’ll define \\(V_i\\) to be the entire unobservable term, \\(\\beta_1 W_i + U_i\\), in the above equation.\nAn instrumental variable, which we’ll call \\(Z\\), needs to satisfy the following two conditions:\n\n\\(\\Cov(Z,V) = 0\\) — This condition is called the exclusion restriction, and it means that the instrument is uncorrelated with the error term in the above equation. In practice, we’d mainly need to make sure that it is uncorrelated with whatever we think is in \\(W\\).\n\\(\\Cov(Z,D) \\neq 0\\) — This condition is called instrument relevance, and it means that the instrument needs to actually affect whether or not an individual participates in the treatment. We’ll see why this condition is important momentarily.\n\nNext, notice that\n\\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\Cov(Z,Y) &= \\Cov(Z,\\beta_0 + \\alpha D + V) \\\\\n  &= \\alpha \\Cov(Z,D)\n  \\end{aligned}\n\\] which holds because \\(\\Cov(Z,\\beta_0) = 0\\) (because \\(\\beta_0\\) is a constant) and \\(\\Cov(Z,V)=0\\) by the first condition of \\(Z\\) being a valid instrument. This implies that\n\\[\n  \\alpha = \\frac{\\Cov(Z,Y)}{\\Cov(Z,D)}\n\\] That is, if we have a valid instrument, the above formula gives us a path to recovering the causal effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\). [Now you can also see why we needed the second condition — otherwise, we could divide by 0 here.]\nThe intuition for this is the following: changes in the instrument can cause changes in the outcome but only because they can change whether or not an individual participates in the treatment. These changes show up in the numerator. They are scaled by how much changes in the instrument result in changes in the treatment.\nIf there are other covariates in the model, the formula for \\(\\alpha\\) will become more complicated. But you can use the ivreg function in the ivreg package to make these complications for you.\n\n17.3.1 Example: Return to Education\nIn this example, we’ll estimate the return to education using whether or not an individual lives close to a college as an instrument for attending college. The idea is that (at least after controlling for some other covariates), the distance that a person lives from a college should not directly affect their earnings but it could affect whether or not they attend college due to it being more or less convenient. I think that the papers that use this sort of an idea primarily have in mind that distance-to-college may affect whether or not a student attends a community college rather than a university.\n\nlibrary(ivreg)\nlibrary(modelsummary)\n\ndata(\"SchoolingReturns\", package=\"ivreg\")\n\nlm_reg &lt;- lm(log(wage) ~ education + poly(experience, 2, raw = TRUE) + ethnicity + smsa + south,\n  data = SchoolingReturns)\n\niv_reg &lt;- ivreg(log(wage) ~ education + poly(experience, 2, raw = TRUE) + ethnicity + smsa + south,\n  ~ nearcollege + poly(age, 2, raw = TRUE) + ethnicity + smsa + south,\n  data = SchoolingReturns)\n\nreg_list &lt;- list(lm_reg, iv_reg)\n\nmodelsummary(reg_list)\n\n\n\n    \n\n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n      \n        \n        \n              \n                 \n                (1)\n                (2)\n              \n        \n        \n        \n                \n                  (Intercept)\n                  4.734\n                  4.066\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.068)\n                  (0.608)\n                \n                \n                  education\n                  0.074\n                  0.133\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.004)\n                  (0.051)\n                \n                \n                  poly(experience, 2, raw = TRUE)1\n                  0.084\n                  0.056\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.007)\n                  (0.026)\n                \n                \n                  poly(experience, 2, raw = TRUE)2\n                  -0.002\n                  -0.001\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.000)\n                  (0.001)\n                \n                \n                  ethnicityafam\n                  -0.190\n                  -0.103\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.018)\n                  (0.077)\n                \n                \n                  smsayes\n                  0.161\n                  0.108\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.016)\n                  (0.050)\n                \n                \n                  southyes\n                  -0.125\n                  -0.098\n                \n                \n                  \n                  (0.015)\n                  (0.029)\n                \n                \n                  Num.Obs.\n                  3010\n                  3010\n                \n                \n                  R2\n                  0.291\n                  0.176\n                \n                \n                  R2 Adj.\n                  0.289\n                  0.175\n                \n                \n                  AIC\n                  40329.6\n                  40778.6\n                \n                \n                  BIC\n                  40377.7\n                  40826.7\n                \n                \n                  Log.Lik.\n                  -1308.702\n                  \n                \n                \n                  F\n                  204.932\n                  \n                \n                \n                  RMSE\n                  0.37\n                  0.40\n                \n        \n      \n    \n\n\n\nThe main parameter of interest here is the coefficient on education. The IV estimates are noticeably larger than the OLS estimates (0.133 relative to 0.074). [This is actually quite surprising as you would think that OLS would tend to over-estimate the return to education. This is a very famous example, and there are actually quite a few “explanations” from labor economists about why this sort of result arises.]",

For example, it’s hard to imagine convincing a large number of countries to randomly assign their interest rate, minimum wage, or immigration policies though these are all policies that economists would be interested in thinking about the causal effect of.\nFor the remainder of this chapter, we’ll discuss common approaches to causal inference when the treatment is not randomly assigned. We’ll start with what is probably the most common approach: unconfoundedness.\nUnconfoundedness Assumption: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  (Y(1),Y(0)) \\independent D | X\n\\end{align*}\\] You can think of this as saying that, among individuals with the same covariates \\(X\\), they have the same distributions of potential outcomes regardless of whether or not they participate in the treatment. Note that the distribution of \\(X\\) is still allowed to be different between the treated and untreated groups. In other words, after you condition on covariates, there is nothing special (in terms of the distributions of potential outcomes) about the group that participates in the treatment relative to the group that doesn’t participate in the treatment.\nIf you are willing to believe this assumption, then you can recover the \\(ATT\\). There are a few different ways that you could implement this. Probably the most common (and convenient) way is to link this condition to a regression (just like we did in the previous section on experiments).\nTo do this, let’s continue to make the treatment effect homogeneity assumption as above. In addition, let’s assume a linear model for untreated potential outcomes \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y(0) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 X_3 + U\n\\end{align*}\\] and unconfoundedness implies that \\(\\E[U|X_1,X_2,X_3,D] = 0\\) (the conditioning on \\(D\\) is the unconfoundedness part). Now, recalling the definition of the observed outcome, we can write \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y_i &= D_i Y_i(1) + (1-D_i) Y_i(0) \\\\\n  &= D_i (Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)) + Y_i(0) \\\\\n  &= D_i \\alpha + \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 X_3 + U_i\n\\end{align*}\\] which suggests running the regression of observed \\(Y\\) on \\(X_1,X_2,X_3,\\) and \\(D\\) and interpreting the estimate of \\(\\alpha\\) as the causal effect of participating in the treatment. In practice, this will be very similar to what we have done before — so the process would not be hard, but convincing someone (or even yourself) that unconfoundedness holds will be the bigger issue here.\nAs a final comment, the assumption of treatment effect homogeneity is not quite so innocuous here. It turns out that you can show that, in the presence of treatment effect heterogeneity, \\(\\alpha\\) will be equal to a weighted average of individual treatment effects, but the weights can sometimes be “strange”. There are methods that are robust to treatment effect heterogeneity (they are beyond the scope of the current class, but they are not “way” more difficult than what we are doing here). That said, in my experience, the regression estimators (under treatment effect homogeneity) tend to deliver similar estimates to alternative estimators that are robust to treatment effect heterogeneity at least in the setup considered in this section.",

    "section": "18.2 Panel Data Approaches",
    "text": "18.2 Panel Data Approaches\nSW All of Ch. 10 and 13.4\nIn the previous section, we invoked the assumption of unconfoundedness and were in the setup where \\(X\\) was fully observed. But suppose instead that you thought this alternative version of unconfoundedness held \\[\\begin{align*}\n  (Y(1),Y(0)) \\independent D | (X,W)\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(X\\) were observed random variables, but \\(W\\) were not observed. Following exactly the same argument as in the previous section, this would lead to a regression like \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y_i = \\alpha D_i + \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\beta_2 W_i + U_i\n\\end{align*}\\] (I’m just including one \\(X\\) and one \\(W\\) for simplicity, but you can easily imagine the case where there are more.) If \\(W\\) were observed, then we could just run this regression, but since \\(W\\) is not observed, we run into the problem of omitted variable bias (i.e., if we just ignore \\(W\\), we won’t be estimating the causal effect \\(\\alpha\\))\nIn this section, we’ll consider the case where a researcher has access to a different type of data called panel data. Panel data is data that follows the same individual (or firm, etc.) over time. In this case, it is often helpful to index variables by time. For example, \\(Y_{it}\\) is the outcome for individual \\(i\\) in time period \\(t\\). \\(X_{it}\\) is the value of a regressor for individual \\(i\\) in time period \\(t\\) and \\(D_{it}\\) is the value of the treatment for individual \\(i\\) in time period \\(t\\). If some variable doesn’t vary over time (e.g., a regressor like race), we won’t use a \\(t\\) subscript.\nPanel data potentially gives us a way around the problem of not observing some variables that we would like to condition on in the model. This is particularly likely to be the case when \\(W\\) does not vary over time. Let’s start with there are exactly two time periods of panel data. In that case, we can write \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y_{it} = \\alpha D_{it} + \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{it} + \\beta_2 W_i + U_{it}\n\\end{align*}\\] where we consider the case where \\(D\\) and \\(X\\) both change over time. Then, defining \\(\\Delta Y_{it} = Y_{it} - Y_{it-1}\\) (and using similar notation for other variables), notice that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\Delta Y_{it} = \\alpha \\Delta D_{it} + \\beta_1 \\Delta X_{it} + \\Delta U_{it}\n\\end{align*}\\] which, importantly, no longer involves the unobserved \\(W_i\\) and suggests running the above regression and interpreting the estimated version of \\(\\alpha\\) as an estimate of the causal effect of participating in the treatment.\n\nTime fixed effects — The previous regression did not include an intercept. It is common in applied work to allow for the intercept to vary over time (i.e., so that \\(\\beta_0 = \\beta_{0,t}\\)) which allows for “aggregate shocks” such as recessions or common trends in outcomes over time. In practice, this amounts to just including an intercept in the previous regression, for example,\n\\[\n    \\Delta Y_{it} = \\underbrace{\\theta_t} + \\alpha \\Delta D_{it} + \\beta_1 \\Delta X_{it} + \\Delta U_{it}\n  \\]\n\nOften, there may be many omitted, time invariant variables. In practice, these are usually just lumped into a single individual fixed effect — even if there are many time invariant, unobserved variables, we can difference them all out at the same time \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y_{it} &= \\alpha D_{it} + \\beta_{0,t} + \\beta_1 X_{it} + \\underbrace{\\beta_2 W_{1i} + \\beta_3 W_{2i} + \\beta_4 W_{3i}} + U_{it} \\\\\n  &= \\alpha D_{it} + \\beta_{0,t} + \\underbrace{\\eta_i} + U_{it}\n\\end{align*}\\] and we can follow the same strategies as above.\nAnother case that is common in practice is when there are more than two time periods. This case is similar to the previous one except there are multiple ways to eliminate the unobserved fixed effect. The two most common are the\n\nWithin estimator\nTo motivate this approach, notice that, if, for each individual, we average their outcomes over time, the we get \\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\bar{Y}_i = \\alpha \\bar{D}_i + \\beta_1 \\bar{X}_i + (\\textrm{time fixed effects}) + \\bar{U}_i\n  \\end{align*}\\] (where I have just written “time fixed effects” to indicate that these are transformed version of original fixed but still show up here.) Subtracting this equation from the expression for \\(Y_{it}\\) gives \\[\\begin{align*}\n    Y_{it} - \\bar{Y}_i = \\alpha (D_{it} - \\bar{D}_i) + \\beta_1 (X_{it} - \\bar{X}_i) + (\\textrm{time fixed effects}) + U_{it} - \\bar{U}_i\n  \\end{align*}\\]\nThis is a feasible regression to estimate (everything is observed here). This is called a within estimator because the terms \\(\\bar{Y}_i\\), \\(\\bar{D}_i\\), and \\(\\bar{X}_i\\) are the within-individual averages-over-time of the corresponding variable.\nFirst differences\nAnother approach to eliminating the unobserved fixed effects is to directly consider \\(\\Delta Y_{it}\\):\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    \\Delta Y_{it} = \\alpha \\Delta D_{it} + \\beta_1 \\Delta X_{it} + \\Delta U_{it}\n  \\end{align*}\\]\nThis is the same expression as we had before for the two period case. Only here you would include observations from all available time periods on \\(\\Delta Y_{it}, \\Delta D_{it}, \\Delta X_{it}\\) in the regression.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning the cases where a fixed effects strategy can break down:\n\nUnobserved variables vary over time\n\\[\n    Y_{it} = \\alpha D_{it} + \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{it} + \\beta_2 \\underbrace{W_{it}} + U_{it}\n  \\] In this case,\n\\[\n    \\Delta Y_{it} = \\alpha \\Delta D_{it} + \\beta_1 \\Delta X_{it} + \\beta_2 \\underbrace{\\Delta W_{it}} + \\Delta U_{it}\n  \\]\nwhich still involves the unobserved \\(W_{it}\\), and implies that the fixed effects regression will contain omitted variable bias.\nThe effect of unobserved variables varies over time\n\\[\n    Y_{it} = \\alpha D_{it} + \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_{it} + \\underbrace{\\beta_{2,t}} W_i + U_{it}\n  \\] In this case,\n\\[\n    \\Delta Y_{it} = \\alpha \\Delta D_{it} + \\beta_1 \\Delta X_{it} + \\underbrace{(\\beta_{2,t} - \\beta_{2,t-1})} W_i + \\Delta U_{it}\n  \\]\nwhich still involves the unobserved \\(W_i\\) (even though it doesn’t vary over time) and, therefore, the fixed effects regressions we have been considering will contain omitted variable bias.\n\nAlso, the assumption of treatment effect homogeneity can potentially matter a lot in this context. This will particularly be the case when (i) individuals can become treated at different points in time, and (ii) there are treatment effect dynamics (so that the effect of participating in the treatment can vary over time) — both of these are realistic in many applications. This is a main research area of mine and one I am happy to talk way more about.\n\n18.2.1 Difference in differences\nThe panel data approaches that we have been talking about so far are closely related to a natural-experiment type of strategy called difference in differences (DID).\nOne important difference relative to the previous approach is that DID is typically implemented when some units (these are often states or particular locations) implement a policy at some time period while others do not; and, in particular, we observe some periods before any units participate in the treatment.\nLet’s think about the case with exactly two time periods: \\(t\\) and \\(t-1\\). In this case, we’ll suppose that the outcomes that we observe are \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y_{it} &= D_i Y_{it}(1) + (1-D_i) Y_{it}(0) \\\\\n  Y_{it-1} &= Y_{it-1}(0)\n\\end{align*}\\] In other words, in the second period, we observe treated potential outcomes for treated units and untreated potential outcomes for untreated units (this is just like the cross-sectional case above). But in the first period, we observe untreated potential outcomes for all units — because no one is treated yet.\nDID is often motivated by an assumption called the parallel trends assumption:\nParallel Trends Assumption \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\E[\\Delta Y_t(0) | D=1] = \\E[\\Delta Y_t(0) | D=0]\n\\end{align*}\\] This says that the path of outcomes that individuals in the treated group would have experienced if they had not been treated is the same as the path of outcomes that individual in the untreated group actually experienced.\nAs before, we continue to be interested in \\[\\begin{align*}\n  ATT = \\E[Y_t(1) - Y_t(0) | D=1]\n\\end{align*}\\] Recall that the key identification challenge if for \\(\\E[Y_t(0)|D=1]\\) here, and notice that \\[\\begin{align*}\n  \\E[Y_t(0) | D=1] &= \\E[\\Delta Y_t(0) | D=1] + \\E[Y_{t-1}(0) | D=1] \\\\\n  &= \\E[\\Delta Y_t(0) | D=0] + \\E[Y_{t-1}(0)|D=1] \\\\\n  &= \\E[\\Delta Y_t | D=0] + \\E[Y_{t-1}|D=1]\n\\end{align*}\\] where the first equality adds and subtracts \\(\\E[Y_{t-1}(0)|D=1]\\), the second equality uses the parallel trends assumption, and the last equality holds because all the potential outcomes in the previous line are actually observed outcome. Plugging this expression into the one for \\(ATT\\) yields: \\[\\begin{align*}\n  ATT = \\E[\\Delta Y_t | D=1] - \\E[\\Delta Y_t | D=0]\n\\end{align*}\\] In other words, under parallel trends, the \\(ATT\\) can be recovered by comparing the path of outcomes that treated units experienced relative to the path of outcomes that untreated units experienced (the latter of which is the path of outcomes that treated units would have experienced if they had not participated in the treatment).\nAs above, it is often convenient to estimate \\(ATT\\) using a regression. In fact, you can show that (in the case with two periods), \\(\\alpha\\) in the following regression is equal to the \\(ATT\\): \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y_{it} = \\alpha D_{it} + \\theta_t + \\eta_i + v_{it}\n\\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\E[v_t | D] = 0\\).\n\n\n18.2.2 Computation\nThe lab in this chapter uses panel data to think about causal effects, so I won’t provide an extended discussion here but rather just mention the syntax for a few panel data estimators. Let’s suppose that you had a data frame that, for the first few rows, looked like (this is totally made up data)\n\n\n  id year         Y       X1 X2\n1  1 2019  87.92934 495.4021  1\n2  1 2020 102.77429 495.6269  1\n3  1 2021 110.84441 495.4844  0\n4  2 2019  76.54302 492.8797  1\n5  2 2020 104.29125 496.1825  1\n6  2 2021 105.06056 492.0129  1\n\n\nThis is what panel data typically looks like — here, we are following a single individual (who is distinguished by their id variable) over three years (from 2019-2021), there is an outcome Y and potential regressors X1 and X2.\nThere are several packages in R for estimating the fixed effects models that we have been considering. I mainly use plm (for “panel linear models”), so I’ll show you that one and then mention one more.\nFor plm, if you want to estimate a fixed effects model in first differences, you would use the plm command with the following sort of syntax\n\nlibrary(plm)\nplm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + as.factor(year),\n    data=name_of_data,\n    effect=\"individual\",\n    model=\"fd\",\n    index=\"id\")\n\nWe include here as.factor(year) to include time fixed effects, effect=\"individual\" means to include an individual fixed effect, model=\"fd\" says to estimate the model in first differences, and index=\"id\" means that the individual identifier is in the column “id”.\nThe code for estimating the model using a within transformation is very similar:\n\nplm(Y ~ X1 + X2 + as.factor(year),\n    data=name_of_data,\n    effect=\"individual\",\n    model=\"within\",\n    index=\"id\")\n\nThe only difference is that model=\"fd\" has been replaced with model=\"within\".\nLet me also just mention that the estimatr package can estimate a fixed effects model using a within transformation. The code for this case would look like\n\nlibrary(estimatr)\n\nlm_robust(Y ~ X1 + X2 + as.factor(year),\n          data=name_of_data,\n          fixed_effects=~id)\n\nI think the advantage of using this approach is that it seems straightforward to get the heteroskedasticity robust standard errors (or cluster-robust standard errors) that are popular in economics (as we have done before for heteroskedasticity robust standard errors for a regression with just cross sectional data). But I am not sure how (or if it is possible) to use estimatr to estimate the fixed effects model in first differences.",

    "text": "18.3 Lab 7: Drunk Driving Laws\nFor this lab, we will use the Fatalities data. We will study the causal effect of mandatory jail sentence policies for drunk driving on traffic fatalities. The Fatalities data consists of panel data of traffic fatality death rates, whether or not a state has a mandatory jail sentence policy or not as well as several other variables from 1982-1988. Economic theory suggests that raising the cost of some behavior (in this case, you can think of a mandatory jail sentence as raising the cost of drunk driving) will lead to less of that behavior. That being said, it’s both interesting to test this theory and also consider the magnitude of this effect. That’s what we’ll do in this problem.\n\nThis data comes in a somewhat messier format than some of the data that we have used previously. To start with, create a new column in the data called afatal_per_million that is the number of alcohol involved vehicle fatalities per millions people in a state in a particular year. The variable afatal contains the total number of alcohol involved vehicle fatalities, and the variable pop contains the total population in a state.\nUsing a subset of the data from 1988, run a regression of afatal_per_million on whether or not a state has a mandatory jail sentence policy jail. How do you interpret the results?\nUsing the same subset from part 2, run a regression of afatal_per_million on jail, unemployment rate (unemp), the tax on a case of beer (beertax), the percentage of southern baptists in the state (baptist), the percentage of residents residing in dry counties (dry), the percentage of young drivers in the state, (youngdrivers), and the average miles driven per person in a state (miles). How do you interpret the estimated coefficient on jail? Would you consider this to be a reasonable estimate of the (average) causal effect of mandatory jail policies on alcohol related fatalities?\nNow, using the full data, let’s estimate a fixed effects model with alcohol related fatalities per million as the outcome and mandatory jail policies as a regressor. Estimate the model using first differences and make sure to include time fixed effects. How do you interpret the results?\nEstimate the same model as in part 4, but using the within estimator instead of first differences. Compare these results to the ones from part 4.\nUsing the same within estimator as in part 5, include the same set of covariates from part 3 and interpret the estimated effect of mandatory jail policies. How do these estimates compare to the earlier ones?\nNow, we’ll switch to using a difference in differences approach to estimating the effect of mandatory jail policies. First, we’ll manipulate the data some.\n\nTo keep things simple, let’s start by limiting the data to the years 1982 and 1988 and drop the in-between periods.\nSecond, let’s calculate the change in alcohol related fatalities per million between 1982 and 1998 and keep the covariates that we have been using from 1982. One way to do this, is to use the pivot_wider function from the tidyr. In the case of panel data, “long format” data means that each row in the data corresponds to a paricular observation and a particular time period. Thus, with long format data, there are \\(n \\times T\\) total rows in the data. On the other hand, “wide format” data means that each row holds all the data (across all time periods) for a particular observation. Converting back and forth between long and wide formats is a common data manipulation task. Hint: This step is probably unfamiliar, so I’d recommend seeing if you can use ?tidyr::pivot_wider to see if you can figure out how to complete this step, but, if not, you can copy this code from the solutions in the next section.\nFinally, drop all states that are already treated in 1982.\n\nUsing the data that you constructed in part 7, implement the difference in differences regression of the change in alcohol related fatalities per million from 1982 to 1988 on the mandatory jail policy. How do you interpret these results and how do they compare to the previous ones? Now, additionally include the set of covariates that we have been using in this model. How do you interpret these results and how do they compare to the previous ones?\nAn alternative to DID, is to include the lagged outcome as a covariate. Using the data constructed in part 7, run a regression of alcohol related fatalities per million in 1988 on the mandatory jail policy and alcohol related fatalities per million in 1982. How do you interpret these results and how do they compare to the previous ones? Now include the additional covariates that we have been using in this model. How do you interpret these results and how do they compare to the previous ones?\nComment on your results from parts 1-9. Which, if any, of these are you most inclined to interpret as a reasonable estimate of the (average) causal effect of mandatory jail policies on alcohol related policies?",

These sorts of specifications are less common in economics, but, in my view, it seems like a reasonable approach here. That said, the results are more or less the same as earlier estimates.\n\nWe don’t have very strong evidence that mandatory jail policies reduced the number traffic fatalities. In my view, probably the best specifications for trying to understand the causal effects are the ones in part 7 (particularly, the ones that include covariates there), but I think that the the results in parts 4-9 are also informative. Broadly, these estimates are more or less similar — none of them are statistically significant and most are positive (which is an unexpected sign).\n\nBefore we finish, let me mention a few caveats to these results:\n\nFirst, I would be very hesitant to interpret these results as definitively saying that mandatory jail policies have no effect on alcohol related traffic fatalities. The main reason to be clear about this is that our standard error are quite large. For example, in the second specification in part 7 (the one I like the most), a 95% confidence interval for our estimate is \\([-23.1, 19.4]\\). This is a wide confidence interval — the average number of alcohol related traffic fatalities per million across all states and time periods is only 66. So our estimates are basically still compatible with very large reductions in alcohol related traffic fatalities up to large increases in alcohol related traffic fatalities.\nLet me make one more comment about the sign of our results. Many of our point estimates are positive; as we discussed earlier, it is hard to rationalize harsher punishments increasing alcohol related traffic fatalities. I think the main explanation for these results is just that our estimates are pretty noisy and, therefore, more or less “by chance” we are getting estimates that have an unexpected sign. But there are some other possible explanations that are worth mentioning. For one, there are a number of other policies related to drunk driving that occurred in the 1980s (particularly, related to legal drinking age) but perhaps others. It is not clear how these would interact with our estimates, but they could certainly play some role. Besides that, it seems to me that we have a pretty good set of covariates that enter our models, but there could be important covariates that we are missing. For this reason, some expertise in how to model state-level traffic fatalities is actually a very important skill here (actually probably the key skill here!)",

    "text": "18.5 Coding Questions\n\nFor this problem, we will use the data rand_hie. This is data from the RAND health insurance experiment in the 1980s. In the experiment, participants were randomly assigned to get Catastrophic (the least amount of coverage), insurance that came with a Deductible, insurance that came with Cost Sharing (i.e., co-insurance so that an individual pays part of their medical insurance), and Free (so that there is no cost of medical care).\nFor this problem, we will be interested in whether or not changing the type of health insurance changed the amount of health care utilization and the health status of individuals.\nWe will focus on the difference between the least amount of health insurance (“Catastrophic”) and the most amount of health insurance (“Free”). In particular, you can start this problem by running the following code:\nrand_hie_subset &lt;- subset(rand_hie, plan_type %in% c(\"Catastrophic\", \"Free\")) rand_hie_subset$free &lt;- 1*(rand_hie_subset$plan_type==\"Free\")\nThis code creates a new data frame called rand_hie_subset that only contains individuals who were assigned to either the “Catastrophic” or “Free” plan types. It also creates a new variable called free that is equal to one for individuals who were assigned to the “Free” plan type and zero for individuals who were assigned to the “Catastrophic” plan type. Use this data frame for the rest of this problem.\n\nSuppose you are interested in estimating the average treatment effect on the treated of the “Free” plan relative to the “Catastrophic” plan on total medical expenditure (total_med_expenditure). Can you estimate this effect by running a regression of total_med_expenditure on free? Explain why or why not.\nEstimate the average treatment effect on the treated of a “Free” plan (free) relative to a “Catastrophic” plan on total medical expenditure (total_med_expenditure) Report and interpret your results.\nEstimate the average treatment effect on the treated of a “Free” plan (free) relative to a “Catastrophic” plan on face to face doctor visits (face_to_face_visits) Report and interpret your results.\nEstimate the average treatment effect on the treated of a “Free” plan (free) relative to a “Catastrophic” plan on overall health index (health_index) Report and interpret your results.\nProvide an overall interpration of your results from parts b-d.\n\nFor this problem, we will study the causal effect of having more children on women’s labor supply using the data Fertility.\n\nTo start with, run a regression of the number of hours that a woman typically works per week (work) on whether or not she has more than two children (morekids). Report your results. Should you interpret the estimated coefficient on morekids as the causal effect of having more than two children? Explain.\nOne possible instrument in this setup is the sex composition of the first two children (i.e., whether they are both girls, both boys, or a boy and a girl). The thinking here is that, at least in the United States, parents tend to have a preference for having both a girl and a boy and that, therefore, parents whose first two children have the same sex may be more likely to have a third child than they would have been if they have a girl and a boy. Go through the lise of four assumptions that we discussed in the context of instrumental variables and provide some discussion about whether or not each of these assumptions are likely to hold in this context.\nRegardless of your answer to part (b), create a new variable called samesex that is equal to one for families whose first two children have the same sex. Estimate the effect of morekids on work using samesex as an instrument for morekids and report the results. Provide some discussion about your results.\n\n\n\n\nFor this question, we will use the AJR data. A deep question in development economics is: Why are some countries much richer than other countries? One explanation for this is that richer countries have different institutions (e.g., property rights, democracy, etc.) that are conducive to growth. Its hard to study these questions though because institutions do not arise randomly — there could be reverse causality so that property rights, democracy, etc. are (perhaps partially) caused by being rich rather than the other way around. Alternatively, other factors (say a country’s geography) could cause both of these. We’ll consider one instrumental variables approach to thinking about this question in this problem.\n\nRun a regression of the log of per capita GDP (the log of per capita GDP is stored in the variable GDP) on a measure of the protection against expropriation risk (this is a measure of how “good” a country’s institutions are (a larger number indicates “better” institutions) and it is in the variable Exprop). How do you interpret these results? Do you think it would be reasonable to interpret the estimated coefficient on Exprop as the causal effect of institutions on GDP.\nOne possible instrument for Exprop is settler mortality (we’ll use the log of this which is available in the variable logMort). Settler mortality is a measure of how dangerous it was for early settlers of a particular location. The idea is that places that have high settler mortality may have set up worse (sometimes called “extractive”) institutions than places that had lower settler mortality. But that settler mortality (from a long time ago) does not have any other direct effect on modern GDP. Provide some discussion about whether settler mortality is a valid instrument for institutions.\nEstimate an IV regression of GDP on Exprop using logMort as an instrument for Exprop. How do you interpret the results? How do these results compare to the ones from part a?\n\nFor this question, we’ll use the data house to study the causal effect of incumbency on the probability that a member of the House of Representatives gets re-elected.\n\nOne way to try to estimate the causal effect of incumbency is to just run a regression where the outcome is democratic_vote_share (this is the same outcome we’ll use below) and where the model includes a binary variable for whether or not the democratic candidate is an incumbent. What are some limitions of this strategy?\nThe house data contains data about the margin of victory (is positive if they won the election and negative if they lost) for Democratic candidates in the current election and data about the Democratic margin of victory in the past election. Explain how you could use this data in a regression discontinuity design to estimate the causal effect of incumbency.\nThe main assumption to rationalize a regression discontinuity design is the continuity assumption. Explain what this assumption means in the context of the regression discontinuity design that you proposed in part b. Do you think that this assumption is likely to hold in this context? Why or why not?\nUse the house data to implement the regression discontinuity design that you proposed in part b. What do you estimate as the causal effect of incumbency?\n\nFor this problem, we will use the data banks. We will study the causal effect of monetary policy on bank closures during the Great Depression. We’ll consider an interesting natural experiment in Mississippi where half the northern half of the state was in St. Louis’s federal reserve district (District 8) and the southern half of the state was in Atlanta’s federal reserve district (District 6). Atlanta had much looser monetary policy (meaning they substantially increased lending) than St. Louis during the early part of the Great Depression and our interest is in whether looser monetary policy made an difference.\n\nPlot the total number of banks separately for District 6 and District 8 across all available time periods in the data.\nAn important event in the South early in the Great Depression was the collapse of Caldwell and Company — the largest banking chain in the South at the time. This happened in November 1930. The Atlanta Fed’s lending markedly increased quickly after this event while St. Louis’s did not. Calculate a DID estimate of the effect of looser monetary policy on the number of banks that are still in business. How do you interpret these results? Hint: You can calculate this by taking the difference between the number of banks in District 6 relative to the number of banks in District 8 across all time periods relative to the difference between the number of banks in District 6 relative to District 8 in the first period (July 1, 1929).",

You have access to student-level data from Georgia where students are eligible for the Hope Scholarship if they can keep their GPA above 3.0.\n\nWhat strategy can use to exploit this institional setting to learn about the causal effect of lower college costs on the probability of going to college?\nWhat sort of data would you need in order to implement this strategy?\nCan you think of any ways that the approach that you suggested could go wrong?\nAnother researcher reads the results from the approach you have implemented and complains that your results are only specific to students who have grades right around the 3.0 cutoff. Is this a fair criticism?\n\nSuppose you are willing to believe versions of unconfoundedness, a linear model for untreated potential outcomes, and treatment effect homogeneity so that you could write \\[\\begin{align*}\n  Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\alpha D_i + \\beta_1 X_i + \\beta_2 W_i + U_i\n\\end{align*}\\] with \\(\\E[U|D,X,W] = 0\\) so that you were willing to interpret \\(\\alpha\\) in this regression as the causal effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\). However, suppose that \\(W\\) is not observed so that you cannot operationalize the above regression.\n\nSince you do not observe \\(W\\), you are considering just running a regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(D\\) and \\(X\\) and interpreting the estimated coefficient on \\(D\\) as the causal effect of \\(D\\) on \\(Y\\).

However, some individuals that were assigned to participate in the treatment decided not to actually participate. Let’s use the following notation: \\(D=1\\) for individuals who actually participated and \\(D=0\\) for individuals who did not participate. \\(Z=1\\) for individuals who were assigned to the treatment and \\(Z=0\\) for individuals assigned not to participate (here, \\(D\\) and \\(Z\\) are not exactly the same because some individuals who were assigned to the treatment did not actually participate).\nYou are considering several different approaches to dealing with this issue. Discuss which of the following are good or bad ideas:\n\nEstimating \\(ATT\\) by \\(\\bar{Y}_{D=1} - \\bar{Y}_{D=0}\\).\nRun the regression \\(Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\alpha D_i + U_i\\) using \\(Z_i\\) as an instrument.\n\nSuppose you and a friend have conducted an experiment (things went well so that everyone complied with the treatment that they were assigned to, etc.). You interpret the difference \\(\\bar{Y}_{D=1} - \\bar{Y}_{D=0}\\) as an estimate of the \\(ATT\\), but your friend says that you should interpret it as an estimate of the \\(ATE\\). In fact, according to your friend, random treatment assignment implies that \\(\\E[Y(1)] = \\E[Y(1)|D=1] = \\E[Y|D=1]\\) and \\(\\E[Y(0)] = \\E[Y(0)|D=0] = \\E[Y|D=0]\\) which implies that \\(ATE = \\E[Y|D=1] - \\E[Y|D=0]\\).

    "text": "18.7 Answers to Some Extra Questions\nAnswer to Question 4\nThe key condition is the parallel trends assumption that says that, in the absence of participating in the treatment, the path of outcomes that individuals in the treated group is the same, on average, as the path of outcomes that individuals in the untreated group actually experienced.\nAnswer to Question 9\n\nWhen some individuals do not comply with their treatment assignment, this approach is probably not so great. In particular, notice that the comparison in this part of the problem is among individuals who actually participated in the treatment relative to those who didn’t (the latter group includes both those assigned not to participate in the treatment along with those assigned to participate in the treatment, but ultimately didn’t actually participate). This suggests that this approach would generally lead to biased estimates of the \\(ATT\\). In the particular context of job training, you can see this would not be such a good idea if, for example, the people who were assigned to the job training program but who did not participate tended to do this because they were able to find a job before the job training program started.\nThis approach is likely to be better. By construction, \\(Z\\) is not correlated with \\(U\\) (since \\(Z\\) is randomly assigned). \\(Z\\) is also likely to be positively correlated with \\(Z\\) (in particular, this will be the case if being randomly assigned to treatment increases the probability of being treated). This implies that \\(Z\\) is a valid instrument and should be able to deliver a reasonable estimate of the effect of participating in the treatment.\n\nAnswer to Question 10\nWhile your friend’s explanation is not technically wrong, it seems to me that you are more right than your friend. There is an important issue related to external validity here. The group of people that show up to participate in the experiment could be (and likely are) quite different from the general population. Interpreting the results of the experiment as being an \\(ATE\\) (in the sense of across the entire population) is therefore likely to be incorrect — or at least would require extra assumptions and/or justifications. Interpreting them as an \\(ATT\\) (i.e., as the effect among those who participated in the treatment) is still perfectly reasonable though.",
